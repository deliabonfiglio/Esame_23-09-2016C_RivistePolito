However, in most practical situations, the system is not known, but a set of measured data is available. In such situations, a two-step procedure is typically adopted: a model is identified from this data set, and a filter is designed based on the identified model. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach, which uses the available data not for the identification of a model, but for the direct design of the filter. Such a direct design is investigated within a parametric-statistical framework for both the cases of linear time-invariant and nonlinear systems. The noise is assumed to be stochastic, and optimality refers to minimizing the estimation error variance. It is shown that the direct design has superior features with respect to the two-step design, especially in the presence of modeling errors. Another relevant advantage of the direct design over the two-step procedure is that minimum variance (Kalman) filters for nonlinear systems are, in general, difficult to derive and/or to implement. On the contrary, the direct approach allows for a very efficient filter design. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed direct design, two examples are presented: the first is related to estimation of the Lorentz chaotic attractor; the second, involving real data, is related to estimation of vehicle yaw rate', 1, 7, 1, 6, '1049-8923', NULL, 'Wiley', NULL, NULL, 'INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBUST AND NONLINEAR CONTROL', '10.1002/rnc.1791'),

To efficiently utilise this new kind of information one task within the ACEM-Rail project is the development of methods for planning predictive maintenance tasks along with preventive and corrective ones in a mid-term planning horizon. The scope of the mid-term or tactical maintenance planning is the selection and combination of tasks and the allocation of tasks to time intervals where they will be executed. Thereby a coarse maintenance plan is determined that defines which tasks are combined together to form greater tasks as well as the time intervals for executing the selected tasks. This tactical plan serves as the base for booking future track possessions and for scheduling the maintenance tasks in detail. In this paper an algorithmic approach is presented which is able to react on dynamic and uncertain changes due to any track prediction updating.

This vision is realized by means of wireless networks, i.e. cheap and small pervasively distributed devices which communicate wireless. Nowadays, these technologies are widely employed for several applications, such as accurate area monitoring and distributed information systems, where the information is directly matched to the items. The strength of a wireless network is the cooperation among nodes: in order to perform its task, a node relies on the information exchanged with other nodes. The nodes and the links of a wireless networks are easily modeled by a family of graphs called unit disk graph (UDG). The degree distribution of a unit disk graph is an important aspect for investigating the behavior of a wireless network. In the literature, several studies was focused on the degree distribution of unit disk graphs, but they lacked in precision. In Chapter 1, the degree distribution is studied with the inclusion of border effects. The achieved results are validated through simulations and compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. RFID technology is a key component in the implementation of pervasive computing. An RFID system consists of small tags containing a microchip and an antenna, readers to acquire data stored in the tags by means of radio frequency signals, and a back-end server for data processing and storage. Due to low production cost, the majority of RFID systems exploits passive tags, i.e. tags without a battery. Their simple integrated circuit is fed by the electromagnetic field emitted by the readers: passive tags operate only in response to a reader interrogation. By means of their automatic identification, physical objects can be easily mapped in an information system. Interferences among readers and tags may prevent communication. Two types of collision can be generated: the reader-to-tag collision, where a tag in the intersection of the interrogation zones of two readers is simultaneously queried by both of them, and the reader-to-reader collision, where two readers disturb each other if they are located within a specific distance called interference range. There are two types of reader collision: reader-to-tag and reader-to-reader collision. The reader-to-tag collision involves readers whose reading areas overlap. They could try to query the same tag at the same time. Although they use different frequency bands, none of them can identify the tag, since the tag has no filtering capabilities. The reader-to-reader collision prevents a reader from correctly identify tags due to the concomitant transmission of another reader. In this case, the weak response of the tags is distorted by the stronger signal of the other reader. An evaluation of the reader-to-reader collisions is often based on simple models that consider only direct collisions among two readers, like for example the unit disk graph model. Instead, more complex models capture the total signal power emitted by each reader and assume that the power of each signal decays as distance grows. Chapter 2 describes the main models of the two families and compare their accuracy. Many protocols have been proposed to reduce reader-to-reader collisions in RFID systems. The majority of them exploits Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) or Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) scheme. Chapter 3 describes the main state-of-the-art approaches and the most effective criteria for their performance evaluation. A distinction among the protocols can be introduced according to their requirements: beside the protocols that are characterized by limited requirements, there are other protocols that require an advanced communication system. Two popular state-of-the-art TDMA protocols that use only one data channel are DCS and Colorwave. A relevant quality of DCS is its fairness, due to the opportunity to reserve a timeslot for the nodes that experience a reader-to-reader collision. Colorwave represents an evolution of DCS, and its main novelty is the introduction of an adaptable parameter. Colorwave maximizes the network throughput, since the readers with few neighbors communicate more often than the ones in denser areas. Moreover, Colorwave is suitable for networks with mobile readers, because it can manage deployment changes, avoiding performance loss. In Chapter 4, three different protocols are proposed, adopting the basic mechanisms common to DCS and Colorwave, and without introducing any additional requirements. Probabilistic Distributed Color Selection (PDCS) introduces in the collision resolution of DCS an additional parameter p, representing the probability of adopting a different behavior after the detection of a collision. Consequently, the number of collisions decreases. Moreover, this protocol allows a multichannel transmission, according to the international RFID regulations. Distributed Color Natural Selection (DCNS) is specifically developed in order to exploit a new configuration, called the Killer configuration. The goal of the proposed configuration is to generate a selfish behavior similar to the natural selection. As a result, the throughput of the network improves and the largest benefit can be get by the RFID readers chosen according to the application specification. Probabilistic Colorwave (PCW) introduces a probabilistic parameter in the collision resolution routine of Colorwave. The effects of this factor are analyzed for two different configurations: the one adopted by Colorwave and the killer configuration adopted by DCNS. With respect to the TDMA protocols that exploits one additional control channel, NFRA provides an optimal management of the readers inside the interference range (neighborhood). However, two drawbacks can be identified in this algorithm. First of all, the algorithm maximizes the throughput, privileging readers with a limited neighborhood, since they have lower probability to be overridden by close transmission. As a consequence, their frequent queries could prevent readers with a larger neighborhood from communicating. To schedule the readers for transmitting, the algorithm assigns to disabled readers the same priority of transmitting ones, so during long executions there may be significant differences among the transmissions performed by each reader. Secondly, some hardware assumptions make the implementation of NFRA in passive RFID systems hard. Two different approaches are described in Chapter 5 in order to mitigate the main drawbacks of NFRA. NFRA++ includes two techniques to improve both the fairness and the throughput of NFRA. Geometric Distribution Reader Anticollision (GDRA) exploits the Sift geometric probability distribution function to minimize reader collision problems. GDRA shows better performance than NFRA, it can be implemented in a real DRE without extra hardware and it is compliant with EPC-ETSI requirements', 0, 0, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Embedded Model Control shows that, the model-based control law must and can be kept intact in the case of uncertainty, if, under certain conditions, the controllable dynamics is complemented by suitable disturbance dynamics capable of real-time encoding the different uncertainties affecting the ‘embedded model\', i.e. the model which is both the design source and the core of the control unit.

The literature is full of studies and experiments with such aerial vehicles (sometimes referred to as aerial robots as well) aiming at very different exploration, commercial and education goals. Here we focus on the test of GNC algorithms for planetary landing that are partly presented in a companion paper submitted to this conference and others submitted elsewhere.

Firstly, the main difference of an on- Earth-flying quadrotor dynamics with respect to a generic planetary landing vehicle is analyzed, showing that a similitude can be formulated, capable of scaling down mass, geometry and trajectories to outdoor tests, and of compensating the different gravity acceleration. As a result, indoor tests look rather critical as they would require small quantization to quadrotor thrusts, in order to keep landing flight duration constant. Similitude to be very accurate needs a careful model of propeller dynamics and response.

The Web removed several access barriers to the information published and has became an enormous space where users can easily navigate through heterogeneous resources (such as linked documents) and can easily edit, modify, or produce them. Documents implicitly enclose information and relationships among them which become only accessible to human beings. Indeed, the Web of documents evolved towards a space of data silos, linked each other only through untyped references (such as hypertext references) where only humans were able to understand. A growing desire to programmatically access to pieces of data implicitly enclosed in documents has characterized the last efforts of the Web research community. Direct access means structured data, thus enabling computing machinery to easily exploit the linking of different data sources. It has became crucial for the Web community to provide a technology stack for easing data integration at large scale, first structuring the data using standard ontologies and afterwards linking them to external data. Ontologies became the best practices to define axioms and relationships among classes and the Resource Description Framework (RDF) became the basic data model chosen to represent the ontology instances (i.e. an instance is a value of an axiom, class or attribute). Data becomes the new oil, in particular, extracting information from semi-structured textual documents on the Web is key to realize the Linked Data vision. In the literature these problems have been addressed with several proposals and standards, that mainly focus on technologies to access the data and on formats to represent the semantics of the data and their relationships. With the increasing of the volume of interconnected and serialized RDF data, RDF repositories may suffer from data overloading and may become a single point of failure for the overall Linked Data vision. One of the goals of this dissertation is to propose a thorough approach to manage the large scale RDF repositories, and to distribute them in a redundant and reliable peer-to-peer RDF architecture. The architecture consists of a logic to distribute and mine the knowledge and of a set of physical peer nodes organized in a ring topology based on a Distributed Hash Table (DHT). Each node shares the same logic and provides an entry point that enables clients to query the knowledge base using atomic, disjunctive and conjunctive SPARQL queries. The consistency of the results is increased using data redundancy algorithm that replicates each RDF triple in multiple nodes so that, in the case of peer failure, other peers can retrieve the data needed to resolve the queries. Additionally, a distributed load balancing algorithm is used to maintain a uniform distribution of the data among the participating peers by dynamically changing the key space assigned to each node in the DHT. Recently, the process of data structuring has gained more and more attention when applied to the large volume of text information spread on the Web, such as legacy data, news papers, scientific papers or (micro-)blog posts. This process mainly consists in three steps: \\emph{i)} the extraction from the text of atomic pieces of information, called named entities; \\emph{ii)} the classification of these pieces of information through ontologies; \\emph{iii)} the disambigation of them through Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) identifying real world objects. As a step towards interconnecting the web to real world objects via named entities, different techniques have been proposed. The second objective of this work is to propose a comparison of these approaches in order to highlight strengths and weaknesses in different scenarios such as scientific and news papers, or user generated contents. We created the Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation (NERD) web framework, publicly accessible on the Web (through REST API and web User Interface), which unifies several named entity extraction technologies. Moreover, we proposed the NERD ontology, a reference ontology for comparing the results of these technologies. Recently, the NERD ontology has been included in the NIF (Natural language processing Interchange Format) specification, part of the Creating Knowledge out of Interlinked Data (LOD2) project. Summarizing, this dissertation defines a framework for the extraction of knowledge from unstructured data and its classification via distributed ontologies. A detailed study of the Semantic Web and knowledge extraction fields is proposed to define the issues taken under investigation in this work. Then, it proposes an architecture to tackle the single point of failure issue introduced by the RDF repositories spread within the Web. Although the use of ontologies enables a Web where data is structured and comprehensible by computing machinery, human users may take advantage of it especially for the annotation task. Hence, this work describes an annotation tool for web editing, audio and video annotation in a web front end User Interface powered on the top of a distributed ontology. Furthermore, this dissertation details a thorough comparison of the state of the art of named entity technologies. The NERD framework is presented as technology to encompass existing solutions in the named entity extraction field and the NERD ontology is presented as reference ontology in the field. Finally, this work highlights three use cases with the purpose to reduce the amount of data silos spread within the Web: a Linked Data approach to augment the automatic classification task in a Systematic Literature Review, an application to lift educational data stored in Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) data silos to the Web of data and a scientific conference venue enhancer plug on the top of several data live collectors. Significant research efforts have been devoted to combine the efficiency of a reliable data structure and the importance of data extraction techniques. This dissertation opens different research doors which mainly join two different research communities: the Semantic Web and the Natural Language Processing community.

	(2497251, 'A convex relaxation approach to set-membership identification', '2012', 'thesis', 'TYPES16', 'Set-membership identification of dynamical systems is dealt with in this thesis. Differently from the stochastic framework, in the set-membership context the statistical description of the measurement noise is not available and the only information on such an error is that its amplitude or energy is bounded. In the framework of Set-membership identification, the result of the estimation process is the set of all system parameter values consistent with measured data, assumed model structure and a-priori assumptions on the measurement error. The problem of evaluating bounds on system parameters belonging to the feasible parameter set can be formulated in terms of polynomial optimization problems, where the number of decision variables increases with the length of the experimental data sequence. Such problems are generally nonconvex and NP-hard. Therefore, standard nonlinear optimization tools can not be used to compute parameter bounds, since they can trap in local minima and, as a consequence, the computed bounds are not guaranteed to contain the true values of parameters, which is a key requirement in set-membership identification. In order to overcome such a problem, convex relaxation procedures based on the theory of moments are proposed to efficiently compute relaxed bounds which are guaranteed to contain the true values of system parameters. Unfortunately, a direct application of the theory of moments in relaxing set-membership identification problems leads to semidefinite programming problems with high computational burden, thus limiting, in practice, the use of such relaxation procedures to solve identification problems with a small number of measurements. The aim of the thesis is to derive a number of convex-relaxation based algorithms that, exploiting the peculiar properties of the considered identification problems, make it possible to perform bound computation also when the number of measurements is large. In particular, errors-in-variables (EIV) identification of linear models, concerning identification of linear-time-invariant (LTI) systems based on noise-corrupted measurements of both input and output signals, is tackled through two different relaxation approaches. The first method, which is referred to as dynamic-EIV approach, exploits the sparse structure of EIV problems in order to reduce the computational complexity of the semidefinite programming problems arising from theory-of-moment relaxations. The second technique, referred to as semi-static-EIV approach, is based on a suitable handling of the constraints defining the feasible parameter set, and leads to polynomial optimization problems where the number of decision variables does not depend on the size of the measurement sequence. Thanks to that problem reformulation, theory-of-moment relaxations can be efficiently applied to compute bounds on system parameters also from large data set. Identification of block-oriented nonlinear systems is also addressed. The considered model structures are: Hammerstein-Wiener systems; Hammerstein-like and Wiener-like structures with backlash nonlinearity and block-structured nonlinear feedback systems. The semi-static-EIV approach is extended with suitable modifications to estimate the parameters of Hammerstein-Wiener models with static blocks described by polynomial functions. Then, a unified approach for set-membership identification of Hammerstein and Wiener models with backlash is discussed. By properly selecting a sequence of input/output measurements, the evaluation of parameter bounds is formulated in terms of polynomial optimization problems and the structured sparsity of the formulated problems is exploited to reduce the computational complexity of theory-of-moment based relaxations. Finally, a two-stage method for identification of block-structured nonlinear feedback systems is presented. Nonlinear block parameter bounds are first computed by using input/output data collected from the response of the system to square wave inputs. Then, by stimulating the system with a persistently exciting input signal, bounds on the unmeasurable inner-signal are evaluated, which are used, together with noise-corrupted measurements of the output signal, to formulate the identification of linear block parameters in terms of EIV problems that can be solved either through the dynamic or the semi-static-EIV approach. Then, an \\"ad hoc\\" convex relaxation scheme is presented to compute guaranteed bounds on the parameters of linear-parameter-varying (LPV) models in input/output (I/O) form, under the assumption that both the output and the scheduling parameter measurements are affected by bounded noise. The developed set-membership identification algorithms are used to derive an LPV model describing vehicle lateral dynamics based on a set of experimental data, and an LPV model to describe glucose-insulin dynamics for patients affected by Type I diabetes. Finally, the problem of identifying systems a-priori known to be stable is discussed. In particular, suitable relaxation-based algorithms are proposed to enforce BIBO stability and quadratic stability constraints for the cases of LTI and LPV systems, respectively. Applicability of the proposed techniques both in the stochastic and in the set-membership framework is discussed', 0, 0, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

The proposed technique is based on the iterated solution, at each step, of a finite-horizon optimal control problem (FHOCP) that takes into account a suitable number of randomly extracted scenarios of uncertainty and disturbances, followed by a specific command selection rule implemented in a receding horizon fashion. The scenario FHOCP is always convex, also when the uncertain parameters and disturbance belong to non-convex sets, and irrespective of how the model uncertainty influences the system\'s matrices. Moreover, the computational complexity of the proposed approach does not depend on the uncertainty/disturbance dimensions, and scales quadratically with the control horizon. The main result in this paper is related to the analysis of the closed loop system under receding-horizon implementation of the scenario FHOCP, and essentially states that the devised control law guarantees constraint satisfaction at each step with some a-priori assigned probability p, while the system\'s state reaches the target set either asymptotically, or in finite time with probability at least p.

However, no optimality properties can be guaranteed by these approximations, and even the stability of the estimation error cannot often be ensured. Another relevant issue is that, in most practical situations, the system whose variables have to be estimated is not known, and a two-step procedure is adopted, based on model identification from data and filter design from the identified model. However, the designed filter may display large performance deteriorations in the case of modeling errors.

The nominal problem formulation for the MPC control law involves the solution, for each sample time, to an optimization problem that is, in general, nonlinear and hard to be solved. The sample time must be greater than the time required to solve the optimization problem and, as a consequence, MPC cannot be directly applied to system with a fast dynamics. To overcome this problem, two possible approaches are proposed here: a set-membership (SM) based technique and a approximation of the optimization solver. The proposed SM based technique, substantially, allows to avoid solving the optimization problem on-line at each sample time. The control move is computed by means of a set of pre-computed solutions to the optimization problem for a given number of different system state values. This approach is potentially applicable to every kind of system, with the disadvantage to require a large amount of memory needed to store the data for the approximation.

DCNS fully exploits the Killer configuration and provides new features, such as dynamic priority management, which modifies the performance of the RFID readers when it is requested.

For instance, in optical-oriented approaches, either the camera sensor or the reference pattern used for tracking are often located within the user\'s sight (or interfere with it), thus occluding portions of the scene or altering the perception of the virtual environment. Several ways to tackle these issues have been recently explored. Proposed approaches basically aim at making the presence of tracking references in the virtual space transparent to the user.

We mainly deal with localization and mapping problems in single and multi robot systems, although some contributions may escape from this classification, involving also decisional processes or more general problems and algorithms. In the first part of the thesis we discuss several approaches for mobile robots Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM): this problem arises when a mobile robot is deployed in an unknown environment and has to build a model of the environment (map) while estimating its own position and orientation (robot pose). SLAM is essentially a large nonlinear estimation problem, and, in this thesis, we address it using different estimation tools (graph-based approaches, Extended Kalman filter, and particle filters). We start by providing innovative insights on the mathematical structure of graph-based maximum likelihood approaches (pose graph optimization problem). We take advantage from these insights to devise efficient estimation strategies that enhance convergence properties of pose graph optimization while reducing the computational effort. Moreover, we propose a formal convergence analysis that justifies empirical observations of related work and provides non-trivial results on the aspects influencing global convergence of graph-based estimation schema based on Gauss-Newton methods. As a second contribution we study an Extended Kalman filter-based SLAM approach, investigating its observability properties and discussing several applications. A third contribution of the first part of the thesis deals with particle filters-based techniques; we present a multi robot extension of the SLAM problem, which relaxes common assumptions of related work. Moreover, we take advantage from the study of SLAM with particle filters to investigate the problem of autonomous exploration under uncertainty, proposing an innovative approach for exploration. This technique is shown to overcome several limitations of state-of-the-art techniques, thus underlining intrinsic limitations of particle filters-based exploration approaches. The second part of the thesis is more heterogeneous, although a main focus is on distributed algorithms for estimation and optimization in multi agent systems. In several application scenarios the input data (e.g., sensor measurements) for performing estimation or optimization are acquired by different nodes that can be geographically distant. In centralized algorithms, input data are gathered by a central computational unit which is in charge of solving the problem for the entire network. In distributed algorithms, instead, the computation is fractioned among the nodes in a network, which have to exploit local computation and communication, in order to reach consensus on a global solution of the problem (e.g., a single estimate for the variable that network\'s sensors are measuring). The distributed setup allows spreading the computation burden and the memory allocation among several processors, reducing inter-nodal communication, and increasing the robustness of the systems with respect to failures of the central computation unit. A first contribution of the second part of the thesis regards a distributed gradient method for multi robot localization from relative distance measurements. The distributed gradient method is proved to converge to the same solution of its centralized counterpart, while providing the benefits of a fully decentralized scheme that can be implemented autonomously by the nodes in the network. Extensive numerical experiments highlight the advantages of using the proposed technique, in terms of convergence speed, computational cost, and communication burden. The algorithm is also suitable for the case in which no synchronization exists among the nodes and it is shown to be scalable in the network size, since it requires inexpensive computation and low memory storage. The last contribution of the thesis is focused on a distributed approach for convex optimization, based on a constraint consensus strategy. We propose an approach, named active constraints consensus, and we show that it is particularly suitable for a specific class of convex programs under uncertainty (random convex programs). In the thesis we prove that, under suitable assumptions, the active constraints consensus algorithm has several desirable properties, including finite-time convergence and limited communication requirements. We also discuss applications of the distributed algorithm, including distributed estimation and classification', 0, 0, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

A prerequisite for a team of robots is the capability of building and maintaining updated maps of the environment. The simultaneous estimation of the trajectory and the map of the environment (known as SLAM) requires many computational resources. Moreover, SLAM is generally performed in environments that do not vary over time (called static environments), whereas real applications commonly require navigation services indynamic environments. This paper focuses on long term mapping operativity in presence of variations in the map, as in the case of robotic applications in logistic spaces, where rovers have to track the presence of goods in given areas. In this context classical SLAM approaches are generally not directly applicable, since they usually apply in static environments or in dynamic environments where it is possible to model the environment dynamics.

The method consists of three parametric phases and can deal with different VLIW processor models.

The rst strategy called gravity turn, employed in past planetary landing, automatically leads to vertical alignment of the velocity vector; vehicle braking together with appropriate touch-down artifacts achieves soft landing. Horizontal motion is constrained, but some freedom must be allowed just after parachute release for separating vehicle and parachute trajectories. The second strategy is assumed here, as it allows free horizontal motion and accurate landing. Trigonometric functions of tilt angles (pitch and yaw) times the vertical acceleration magnitude become the horizontal acceleration. Instead of designing a hierarchical guidance and control in which horizontal acceleration becomes attitude reference, a unique control system has been designed based on the fourth order dynamics from angular acceleration to position. Following the Embedded Model Control methodology, a unique discrete-time state equation has been derived, encompassing horizontal, vertical and spin motions, to be used by guidance, navigation and control. Propulsion has been split into a main assembly for CoM guidance and control (9 to 12 thrusters slighted canted from the axial direction) and a secondary assembly for spin damping. The latter could be used for the guided entry from the entry point to parachute deployment. Here only guidance is presented with a brief mention to control strategies, as they have been treated elsewhere. Navigation concepts are in Acta Astronautica, 2012. Guidance has been designed to track a variable landing site, to reduce propellant consumption and to account for vehicle tilt limitations due to on board sensors like radar altimeter/velocimeter and camera. Guidance is recomputed during the descent until a minimum altitude is reached.

In this paper we propose a novel modelling approach, based on a geometric representation of device configurations (i.e. the policies) which permits the computation of the reachability using the concept of equivalent firewall. An equivalent firewall is a fictitious device, ideally connected directly to the communication endpoints, that summarizes the network behaviour between them. Our model supports routing, filtering and address translation devices in a computationally effective way. In fact, the experimental results show that the computation of equivalent firewalls is performed in a negligible time and that afterwards the reachability queries are answered in few seconds', 1, 0, 1, 0, NULL, '9781467353212', 'IEEE Computer Society Press', 'PDP-2013: 21st Euromicro International Conference on Parallel, Distributed, and Network-Based Processing', 'Titolo volume non avvalorato', NULL, '10.1109/PDP.2013.86'),

The typical configuration of these packaging plants consists of a set of sequential robot stations, performing pick and place cycles from one conveyor to another parallel one, which transport the products and the boxes to be filled. Depending on the relative movement of the two conveyors, the plant operates in co-current or counter-current flow configuration. Undesired perturbations in the product flow rate from its nominal value can lead to critical events, i.e. unpicked product at the end of the first conveyor or not-completely filled boxes. Even if the structures of co-current flow and of counter-current flow plants, are very similar, their behaviour in non-nominal or perturbed conditions can be significantly different. The aim of this paper is to deeply investigate the behaviour of these two kinds of secondary packaging lines, evaluating their performances in the case of different pick and place strategies, using discrete events simulation techniques. Results show to which extent the different proposed control strategies can improve the performances of both co-current and counter-currents plants and, in particular, how co-current plant layouts can achieve performances which are equivalent to, or perhaps even better than, those that can be obtained with a counter-current plant layout, that cannot be freely used since it has been patented.

On the other hand, existing techniques for fast high-level simulation do not provide enough details for NFP analysis. The goal of this paper is to bridge this gap by combining the accuracy of low-level models with high-level simulation speed. We introduce an efficient mixed-level NFP prediction methodology that considers both the structure and application of a system.

Although currently the H.264/AVC rate-distortion performance in case of no loss is better than state-of-the-art DVC schemes, under practical packet lossy conditions, the proposed techniques provide better performance with respect to an H.264/AVC-based system, especially at high packet loss rates. Thus the error resilience of the proposed DVC scheme is superior to the one provided by H.264/AVC, especially in the case of transmission over packet lossy networks', 1, 1, 1, 3, '0091-3286', NULL, 'SPIE (Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers)', NULL, NULL, 'OPTICAL ENGINEERING', '10.1117/1.OE.52.7.071506'),

Modern smart environments are equipped with a multitude of smart devices and sensors, aimed at delivering intelligent services to the users of smart environments. The presence of these diverse smart devices has raised a major problem of managing environments. A rising solution to the problem is the modeling of user goals and intentions, and then interacting with the environments using user defined goals. `Domotic Effects\' is a user goal modeling framework, which provides Ambient Intelligence (AmI) designers and integrators with an abstract layer that enables the definition of generic goals in a smart environment, in a declarative way, which can be used to design and develop intelligent applications. The high-level nature of domotic effects also allows the residents to program their personal space as they see fit: they can define different achievement criteria for a particular generic goal, e.g., by defining a combination of devices having some particular states, by using domain-specific custom operators.

	(2507391, 'New Techniques for Reliability Characterization of Electronic Circuits', '2013', 'thesis', 'TYPES16', 'Integrated electronic systems are increasingly used in an wide number of applications and environments, ranging from critical missions to low cost consumer products. Information processing has been thoroughly integrated into everyday objects and activities, in the so-called ubiquitous computing paradigm. This wide distribution is caused mainly by the miniaturization of semiconductor devices (transistor channel length scaling from 180 nm in 1999 to 22 nm in 2012), which allows integrating a complete system on a single chip (SoC). However, there are many difficult challenges associated with continued cost reduction, size reduction, improved performance and improved power efficiency. One of these challenges is the reliability of these electronic systems. Important research efforts are aimed at improving the reliability of semiconductors. Manufacturing processes, intrinsic aging phenomena of components and environmental stress may cause internal defects and damages during the lifetime of a system, possibly causing misbehaviours or failures. In order to guarantee product quality and consumer satisfaction, it is necessary not only to discover faults as soon as possible in the manufacturing process, but also to continuously check for their absence throughout a product lifetime. Today\'s modern systems have become increasingly complex to design and build, while the demand for reliability and cost effective development continues. Reliability is one of the most important attributes in all these systems, including aerospace applications, real-time control, medical care, defence equipment, transportation, communication, entertainment products, agriculture, energy and environmental systems. Growing international competition has increased the need for all designers, managers, practitioners, scientists and engineers to ensure a high level of reliability of their product before release and during mission time, at the lowest cost. The interest in reliability has been growing in recent years and this trend will continue during the next decade and beyond. With testers being expensive pieces of equipment and the cost of transistors continuously decreasing, it make sense to use some of these low-cost transistors to replace the costly test tools, whenever possible. The first low cost approach we can think about is using the devices themselves to implement their own test. This is the underlying motivation of functional Software-Based Self-Test (SBST): a fast, powerful microprocessor, which has lots of resources, could certainty help in its testing procedure. Having the outstanding advantages of enabling at-speed testing, zero area overhead and actually testing the device\'s operation, this approach also has some drawbacks. Even if SBST is essentially suitable for online testing (and sometimes it is the only possible approach), it requires some dedicated system memory for the functional testing data, which can reach very big sizes. Also some faults happen to be functionally untestable; i.e., you cannot detect them exclusively by running proper software routines. For this reason a combination of both functional and structural test approaches is common practise. A second natural approach to low cost testing is design for test (DfT). Add some extra (cheap) area on-chip specifically in charge of performing and managing tests. The DfT path started long ago, but it is still a key element in 2012 International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS)[1] test roadmap. Different sorts of DfT enable the use of low cost testers, contributing to the full checking of a device, and may also be reused for online testing purposes. Logic and Memory Built-In Self Test (BIST) schemas are usual practises. Analogue DfT, even if it is not as advances as digital one, is also an interesting strategy, especially when the analogue or mixed-signal device is integrated in a wider digital system like a SoC Finally, there are some fields where the use of external (and generally expensive) testers is mandatory. Diagnosis is one of the cases in which an Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) is needed to store the huge amount of retrieved data and to drive the cyclic characteristic of the diagnosis procedure. In particular, even if memories are commonly tested making use of internal BIST structures, their diagnosis demands the use of a tester. Another interesting and blooming field is that of the mixed energy-domain devices as Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS). MEMS require unique testing apparatus applying both electrical and physical stimuli: movement, pressure, magnetic fields. Additionally, they not only need to be exhaustively tested but in most of the cases also calibrated. The work described in this thesis falls in low cost testing domain. Strategies for new and/or improved SBST, DfT and ATE mechanisms are proposed, implemented and evaluated. The strategies deal mainly with memories, processor and mixed-signal devices (analogue-to-digital converters is our target device) embedded in Systems-on-a-Chip, where standard communication protocols and wrappers are used to communicate with the device under test', 0, 0, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Flow regulation is the result of the accurate positioning of a spool driven by a solenoid and a position sensor, usually a Linear Variable Differential Transformer. The overall control consists of two hierarchical loops: the inner loop is the solenoid current regulator with a closed-loop bandwidth close to 1 kHz. A model-based digital regulator of this kind has been presented elsewhere: requirements and performance are here reminded. The outer loop is a position tracking control, in charge of an accurate positioning of the spool with respect to the valve openings. The paper addresses the outer loop and concentrates on the conversion of an existing industrial analogue controller into a digital one. The analogue controller is a nonlinear proportional, integrative and derivative controller including a second-order derivative, and is capable of recovering a dead-band hysteresis. The digital conversion provides the necessary position derivatives through a state predictor, in order to withstand the 5-kHz Nyquist limit of the power supplier.

Their importance is confirmed both by their wide range of scientific and technological applications they are able to address and by their theoretical implications. In fact, they are exploited in many fields such as computer science and technologies, industrial applications, transportation and logistics, and telecommunications. From a theoretical perspective, packing problems often appear as sub-problems in order to iteratively solve bigger problems. Although packing problems play a fundamental role in all these settings, there is a gap in terms of comprehensive study in the literature. In fact, the joint presence of both compulsory and non-compulsory items has not been considered yet. This particular setting arises in many real-life applications, not yet addressed or only partially addressed by the current state-of-the-art packing problems. Furthermore, little has been done in terms of unified methodologies, and different techniques have been used in order to solve packing problems with different objective functions. In particular, none of these techniques is able to address the presence of compulsory and non-compulsory items at the same time. In order to overcome a noteworthy portion of this gap, we formulated a new packing problem, named the Generalized Bin Packing Problem (GBPP), characterized by both compulsory and non-compulsory items, and multiple item and bin attributes. Packing problems have also been studied within stochastic settings where the items are affected by uncertainty. In these settings, there are fundamentally two kinds of stochasticity concerning the items: 1) stochasticity of the item attributes, where one attribute is affected by uncertainty and modeled as a random variable or 2) stochasticity of the item availability, i.e., the items are not known a priori but they arrive on-line in an unpredictable way to a decision maker. Although packing problems have been studied according to these stochastic variants, the GBPP with uncertainty on the items is still an open problem. Therefore, we have also studied two stochastic variants of the GBPP, named the Stochastic Generalized Bin Packing Problem (S-GBPP) and the On-line Generalized Bin Packing Problem (OGBPP).

Companies thus face the problem of planning for sufficient capacity, e.g., negotiating it with third party logistic firms (3PLs) that specify both the capacity to be used and the logistical services to be performed. Given the time lag that usually exists between the capacity-planning decisions and the operational decisions that define how the planned capacity is used, the common assumption that all information concerning the parameters of the model is known is unlikely to be observed.

Bins included in the capacity plan are chosen in advance without the exact knowledge of what items will be available for the dispatching.

The proposed algorithm, the Variable Neighborhood Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm (VN-MGA), is a Genetic Algorithm based on the NSGA-II, with the particular feature that solutions are encoded defining two different kinds of neighborhoods. The first neighborhood is defined by considering as decision variables the edges that form the routes to be followed by each request, whilst the second part of solution is kept constant. The second neighborhood is defined by considering the request sequence as decision variable, with the first part kept constant. Comparisons are performed with: (i) a VNS algorithm that performs a switch between the same two neighborhoods that are used in VN-MGA; and (ii) the results obtained with an integer linear programming solver, running a scalarized version of the multiobjective problem. The results indicate that the proposed VN-MGA outperforms the pure VNS algorithm, and provides a good approximation of the exact Pareto fronts obtained with Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach, at a much smaller computational cost.

This work proposes a classification approach based on Subclass Discriminant Analysis (SDA), a dimensionality reduction technique that provides an effective representation of the cells in the feature space, suitably coping with the high within-class variance typical of HEp-2 cell patterns. In order to generate an adequate characterization of the fluorescence patterns, we investigate the individual and combined contributions of several image attributes, showing that the integration of morphological, global and local textural features is the most suited for this purpose.

In this setting, traceability consists of the ability to determine for each portion of intermediate or final product, in any part of the plant, its relative composition in terms of supply-lots fed into the system as well as of new lots generated during the production process. Traceability becomes particularly difficult in the very common case when bulk products, such as liquids or grains, are involved in the production chain. Current traceability practices are in most cases unable to directly deal with bulk products, and typically resort to the definition of very large lots to compensate the lack of knowledge about lot composition.

Just focusing on the roles of micro RNAs (miRNAs), they have been found to be part of several intra-pathway regulatory motifs. However, inter-pathway regulatory mechanisms have been often neglected and require further investigation. Results In this paper we present the result of a systems biology study aimed at analyzing a high-level inter-pathway regulatory motif called Pathway Protection Loop, not previously described, in which miRNAs seem to play a crucial role in the successful behavior and activation of a pathway. Through the automatic analysis of a large set of public available databases, we found statistical evidence that this inter-pathway regulatory motif is very common in several classes of KEGG Homo Sapiens pathways and concurs in creating a complex regulatory network involving several pathways connected by this specific motif. The role of this motif seems also confirmed by a deeper review of other research activities on selected representative pathways. Conclusions Although previous studies suggested transcriptional regulation mechanism at the pathway level such as the Pathway Protection Loop, a high-level analysis like the one proposed in this paper is still missing.

However, for the specific case of video coding, standards do not specify it, thus different decoders may - and typically do - use different concealment techniques. This work investigates the impact of assuming, in the transmission optimization phase, a concealment algorithm different from the one that is actually used by the decoder, in order to determine which are the best assumptions to use at the transmitter. Firstly, we investigate the typical performance provided by ten concealment techniques belonging to three widely used algorithmic families (spatial, temporal and mixed). Then, we assess the impact that an incorrect concealment assumption causes, in terms of both packet transmission policy changes and video quality degradation, using a simple rate-distortion transmission optimization technique that targets a generic two QoS-level network. Simulation results over several standard video sequences show that the performance impact of incorrectly assuming the decoder-side concealment technique may be significant but it is limited if the two techniques belong to the same algorithmic family. Moreover, the impact on performance caused by incorrect assumptions is strongly mitigated if the decoder employs a high-performance concealment algorithm.

Remote visualization solutions allows to decouple computing resources on one side and visualization resources on the other side; rendering servers are in charge to compute and stream to the user\'s device the output graphics of the intended software as a sequence of individual frames. However, the provision of highly graphics-oriented software within a cloud can be particularly challenging due to a number of technological limitations from bandwidth requirements to latency-related issues.

Generally, the solution advocates that the goals can be achieved by controlling the evolution of the states of the devices. In order to automatically reach a particular state, a sophisticated solution is required through which the respective commands, notifications and their correct sequence can be discovered and enforced on the real devices. In this paper, a comprehensive methodology is proposed by considering a ) the composite nature of the state of an individual device; b ) the possible variation of specific commands, notifications and their sequence based on the current states of the devices.

At design-time, it constructs the extended data and control flow behavioral graphs of the devices by using the concepts of a model checking approach.

As a significant advancement, satellite-to-satellite distance variations, encoding gravity anomalies, will be measured by laser interferometry with an accuracy improvement of at least three orders of magnitude with respect to GRACE radiometric measurements [4]. The formation will fly in a polar orbit at an Earth altitude between 300 and 400 km, which requires drag cancellation (drag-free control) and orbit/formation control. Drag-free control uses the ultrafine accelerometers of the GOCE mission. Orbit and formation control use the receivers of a Global Navigation System (GNS) mounted on each satellite and a suitable satellite interlink. Orbit and formation actuators have been selected among millinewton electric thrusters. Two kinds of formation have been studied: in line formation where the two satellites move on the same polar orbit, and pendulum formation where the satellites move on RAAN separated orbits. The paper focuses on the orbit and formation control, whose aim is the orbit and formation long-term stability (> 10 years) though admitting large \'natural\' fluctuations around the reference values. Drag-free control by itself, being an acceleration control, is not capable of achieving orbit and formation stability, although the non-gravitational acceleration residuals must be very small and bounded. The reason is that Hill\'s perturbation equations (orbit and formation) are not bounded-input-bounded-output (BIBO) stable (longitudinal and radial components), and position/velocity feedback becomes mandatory. The design of the control loop presented here appears not conventional for different reasons. Firstly it must not alter the zero-mean near-periodical free response of the local gravity field, but it must only zero the \'secular\' free response components (bias, drift) and stabilize the perturbed dynamics to achieve BIBO stability. Stabilization programs of this sort are implemented by ground stations through impulsive commands and aim to stabilize orbit altitude (as for GOCE [5]) and to achieve and stabilize formations. Secondly we look for a \'continuous\' control with the aim of respecting drag-free residuals above 1 mHz, where gravity anomalies should be detected. A stepwise command changing each orbit has been proved being capable of stabilizing orbit and formation without degrading drag-free residuals. The relevant perturbed dynamics sampled at the orbit period has been proved to allow controllability of the required variables. Third, orbit and formation con-trol have been integrated in a unique three degrees-of-freedom (DoF) control system, aiming at stabilizing the \'formation triangle\' consisting of the satellite CoMs and of the Earth CoM. The three degrees are the formation distance, the formation radius and the non orthogonality (it expresses the difference between the satellite orbit altitudes). Other degrees to be controlled, but not treated here are yaw and roll rates. Control has been designed using the Embedded Model control methodology [6] and is organized in a hierarchical way where drag-free plays the role of wide-band inner loop, and orbit/formation control plays the role of narrow band, under-sampled outer loop. The paper will start with the formation triangle dynamic model, which is credited to be a new set of formation perturbation equations.

However, its practical applicability is highly limited by its static approach to abstraction, and the intrinsic difficulty to find an acceptable trade-off between accuracy and memory/time complexity. In this paper, we use SAT-based cube generalization, a core step of the IC3 model checking algorithm, in order to strengthen BDD-based representations of state sets. More specifically, we use cube generalization, in both its inductive and non-inductive versions, to tighten BDD-based over-approximate representations of state sets computed by Machine by Machine (MBM) and Frame by Frame (FBF) algorithms. The resulting approach benefits from the orthogonal power of BDD and CNF representations, and it improves the scalability and applicability in verification of BDD-based methods.

This paper shows that a similar result can be achieved in a fully automated way, using a different model-driven approach and state-of-the-art automated verification tools. The proposed method splits the verification problem into two independent sub-problems using compositional verification techniques and exploits one tool for analyzing the security protocol under active attackers and another tool for verifying the application logic. The same case study that was verified in the previous work is used here in order to show how the new approach works', 0, 0, 1, 0, '0302-9743', '9783319048963', 'Springer', 'Engineering Secure Software and Systems (ESSOS)', 'Engineering Secure Software and Systems, Lecture Notes in Computer Science', 'LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE', '10.1007/978-3-319-04897-0_4'),

RCPs are convex optimization problems with a (usually large) number N of randomly extracted constraints; they arise in several application areas, especially in the context of decision-making under uncertainty, see [2, 3]. We here consider a setup in which instances of the random constraints (the scenario) are not held by a single centralized processing unit, but are instead distributed among different nodes of a network. Each node \\"sees\\" only a small subset of the constraints, and may communicate with neighbors. The objective is to make all nodes converge to the same solution as the centralized RCP problem. To this end, we develop two distributed algorithms that are variants of the constraints consensus algorithm [4, 5]: the active constraints consensus (ACC) algorithm, and the vertex constraints consensus (VCC) algorithm. We show that the ACC algorithm computes the overall optimal solution in finite time, and with almost surely bounded communication at each iteration of the algorithm. The VCC algorithm is instead tailored for the special case in which the constraint functions are convex also w.r.t. the uncertain parameters, and it computes the solution in a number of iterations bounded by the diameter of the communication graph. We further devise a variant of the VCC algorithm, namely quantized vertex constraints consensus (qVCC), to cope with the case in which communication bandwidth among processors is bounded. We discuss several applications of the proposed distributed techniques, including estimation, classification, and random model predictive control, and we present a numerical analysis of the performance of the proposed methods.

Modeling and control design follows the Embedded Model Control methodology. We distinguishe be-tween orbit and formation control: orbit control applies to a single satellite and performs altitude control. Formation control is formulated as a control capable of altitude and distance control at the same time. The satellites being placed in a low Earth orbit, orbit and formation control employ the measurements of a global navigation system. Formation control is imposed by long-distance laser interferometry, which is the key instrument together with GOCE-class accelerometers for gravity measurement. Orbit and formation control are low-frequency control systems in charge of cancelling the bias and drift of the residual drag-free accelerations. Drag-free control is the core of orbit/formation control since it makes the formation to fly drag-free only subject to gravity. Drag-free is demanded by the low-Earth orbit and by the accelerometer systematic errors. Drag-free control being required to have a bandwidth close to 1 Hz, is designed as the inner loop of the formation control, but formation control must not destroy drag-free performance, which is obtained by restricting formation control to be effective only below orbital frequency.

The most popular current solutions - Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and statistical classification, deeply rely on the availability of a training set. Besides the cumbersome need to regularly update the signatures, their visibility is limited to classes the classifier has been trained for. Unsupervised algorithms have been envisioned as a viable alternative to automatically identify classes of traffic. However, the accuracy achieved so far does not allow to use them for traffic classification in practical scenario. To address the above issues, we propose Select, a Self-Learning Classifier for Internet Traffic. It uses unsupervised algorithms along with an adaptive seeding approach to automatically let classes of traffic emerge, being identified and labeled. Unlike traditional classifiers, it requires neither a-priori knowledge of signatures nor a training set to extract the signatures. Instead, Select automatically groups flows into pure (or homogeneous) clusters using simple statistical features. Select simplifies label assignment (which is still based on some manual intervention) so that proper class labels can be easily discovered. Furthermore, Select uses an iterative seeding approach to boost its ability to cope with new protocols and applications. We evaluate the performance of Select using traffic traces collected in different years from various ISPs located in 3 different continents.

Such a joint benefit has been exploited only partially because of the different nature of energy and aging as cost functions: as a performance figure, aging is affected by the worst idleness pattern. Therefore, large potential energy savings usually result in limited aging reductions. In this paper, we address this problem in the context of power-managed caches, which represent a critical target for NBTI-reduced aging: given their symmetric structure, SRAM structures are, in particular, sensitive to NBTI effects because they cannot take advantage of the value-dependent recovery typical of NBTI. We propose a strategy called dynamic indexing, in which the cache indexing function is changed over time in order to uniformly distribute the idleness over all the various power managed units (e.g., lines). This distribution allows fully using the leakage optimization potential and extending the lifetime of a cache. We explore various alternatives, in particular different granularities of the power managed units as well as different reindexing functions.

To gain further insight on the genetics and pathogenic mechanisms of aggressive PTCLs we performed whole exome sequencing of matched tumor and normal DNA samples from 12 PTCL patients including 6 PTCL not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) tumors, 3 angioimunoablastic (AITL) T-cell lymphomas, 2 nasal type NK-/T-cell lymphomas and one enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL). This analysis identified 288 candidate coding somatic mutations in 268 genes and a mean mutation load of 24 non synonymous mutations per sample (range 4 - 57). Among these we noted the presence of a recurrent heterozygous mutation in the RHOA small GTPase gene (RHOA G17V) present in two independent AITL samples and one PTCL NOS biopsy. Analysis of a broad and diverse panel of 126 PTCL samples identified the presence of the RHOA G17V allele in 32 samples with a high prevalence in AITL (24/36, 67%, P < 0.001) and PTCL NOS cases (8/44, 18%, P < 0.002). The RHOA protein belongs to the Rho family of small GTPases, a group of Ras-like proteins responsible for linking a variety of cell-surface receptors to different intracellular signaling proteins. As is the case for RAS and most other small GTPases, RHOA activation is mediated by guanine exchange factors (GEFs), which catalyze the switch of RHOA from an inactive GDP-bound to an active GTP-bound state. Thus, and to test the functional significance of the RHOA G17V mutation we analyzed the capacity of this mutant to load GTP. This analysis revealed that RHOA G17V fails to incorporate GTP in response to an activated GEF in vitro. Moreover, and consistent with its inability to bind GTP, RHOA G17V failed to interact with rhotekin, a RHOA effector protein that selectively interacts with the GTP-bound active form of RHOA. However and most notably, the lack of RHOA G17V activation is not the result of a defect in RHOA-GEF interaction as RHOA G17V pull down assays demonstrated effective binding of this mutant protein to activated GEF proteins in T-cells. Based on these results we proposed an inhibitory role for RHOA G17V via sequestration of active GEF proteins.

At the same time, it is particularly challenging, since image resolution and signal-to-noise ratio are generally very low, while the nonrigidity of the human body produces highly variable target shapes. Moreover, motion can be quite chaotic with frequent target-to-target and target-to-scene occlusions. Hence, the trend is to design ever more sophisticated techniques, able to ensure rather accurate tracking results at the cost of a generally higher complexity. However, many of such techniques might not be suitable for real-time tracking in limited-resource environments. This work presents a technique that extends an extremely computationally efficient tracking method based on target intensity variation and template matching originally designed for targets with a marked and stable hot spot by adapting it to deal with much more complex thermal signatures and by removing the native dependency on configuration choices.

Indeed, S-W is able to ensure better accuracy levels with respect to the heuristic alignment algorithms by extensively exploring all the possible alignment configurations between the sequences under examination. It has been proven that the first amino acid (AA) or nucleotide (NT) inserted/deleted (that identify a gap open) found during the alignment operations performed on sequences is more significant from a biological point of view than the subsequent ones (called gap extension), making the so called Affine Gap model a viable solution for biomolecules alignment. However, this version of S-W algorithm is expensive both in terms of computation as well as in terms of memory requirements with respect to others less demanding solutions such as the ones using a Linear Gap model. In order to overcome these drawbacks we have developed an optimised version of the S-Walgorithm based on Affine Gap model called Dynamic Gap Selector (DGS S-W).

It implies a global alliance for developing quality software with quick bug fixing along with quick evolution of the software features. In the recent year tendency toward adoption of OSS in industrial projects has swiftly increased. Many commercial products use OSS in various fields such as embedded systems, web management systems, and mobile software\'s. In addition to these, many OSSs are modified and adopted in software products. According to Netcarf survey more than 58% web servers are using an open source web server, Apache. The swift increase in the taking on of the open source technology is due to its availability, and affordability. Recent empirical research published by Forrester highlighted that although many European software companies have a clear OSS adoption strategy; there are fears and questions about the adoption. All these fears and concerns can be traced back to the quality and reliability of OSS. Reliability is one of the more important characteristics of software quality when considered for commercial use. It is defined as the probability of failure free operation of software for a specified period of time in a specified environment (IEEE Std. 1633-2008). While open source projects routinely provide information about community activity, number of developers and the number of users or downloads, this is not enough to convey information about reliability. Software reliability growth models (SRGM) are frequently used in the literature for the characterization of reliability in industrial software. These models assume that reliability grows after a defect has been detected and fixed. SRGM is a prominent class of software reliability models (SRM). SRM is a mathematical expression that specifies the general form of the software failure process as a function of factors such as fault introduction, fault removal, and the operational environment. Due to defect identification and removal the failure rate (failures per unit of time) of a software system generally decreases over time. Software reliability modeling is done to estimate the form of the curve of the failure rate by statistically estimating the parameters associated with the selected model. The purpose of this measure is twofold: 1) to estimate the extra test time required to meet a specified reliability objective and 2) to identify the expected reliability of the software after release (IEEE Std. 1633-2008). SRGM can be applied to guide the test board in their decision of whether to stop or continue the testing. These models are grouped into concave and S-Shaped models on the basis of assumption about cumulative failure occurrence pattern. The S-Shaped models assume that the occurrence pattern of cumulative number of failures is S-Shaped: initially the testers are not familiar with the product, then they become more familiar and hence there is a slow increase in fault removing. As the testers\' skills improve the rate of uncovering defects increases quickly and then levels off as the residual errors become more difficult to remove. In the concave shaped models the increase in failure intensity reaches a peak before a decrease in failure pattern is observed. Therefore the concave models indicate that the failure intensity is expected to decrease exponentially after a peak was reached. From exhaustive study of the literature I come across three research gaps: SRGM have widely been used for reliability characterization of closed source software (CSS), but 1) there is no universally applicable model that can be applied in all cases, 2) applicability of SRGM for OSS is unclear and 3) there is no agreement on how to select the best model among several alternative models, and no specific empirical methodologies have been proposed, especially for OSS. My PhD work mainly focuses on these three research gaps. In first step, focusing on the first research gap, I analyzed comparatively eight SRGM, including Musa Okumoto, Inflection S-Shaped, Geol Okumoto, Delayed S-Shaped, Logistic, Gompertz and Generalized Geol, in term of their fitting and prediction capabilities. These models have selected due to their wide spread use and they are the most representative in their category. For this study 38 failure datasets of 38 projects have been used. Among 38 projects, 6 were OSS and 32 were CSS. In 32 CSS datasets 22 were from testing phase and remaining 10 were from operational phase (i.e. field). The outcomes show that Musa Okumoto remains the best for CSS projects while Inflection S-Shaped and Gompertz remain best for OSS projects. Apart from that we observe that concave models outperform for CSS and S-Shaped outperform for OSS projects. In the second step, focusing on the second research gap, reliability growth of OSS projects was compared with that of CSS projects. For this purpose 25 OSS and 22 CSS projects were selected with related defect data. Eight SRGM were fitted to the defect data of selected projects and the reliability growth was analyzed with respect to fitted models. I found that the entire selected models fitted to OSS projects defect data in the same manner as that of CSS projects and hence it confirms that OSS projects reliability grows similarly to that of CSS projects. However, I observed that for OSS S-Shaped models outperform and for CSS concave shaped models outperform. To overcome the third research gap I proposed a method that selects the best SRGM among several alternative models for predicting the residuals of an OSS. The method helps the practitioners in deciding whether to adopt an OSS component, or not in a project. We test the method empirically by applying it to twenty one different releases of seven OSS projects. From the validation results it is clear that the method selects the best model 17 times out of 21. In the remaining four it selects the second best model', 0, 0, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

On the negative side, this rapid scaling however also translates to high power densities, higher operating temperatures and reduced reliability making it imperative to address design issues that have cropped up in its wake. In particular, the aggressive physical miniaturization have increased CMOS fault sensitivity to the extent that many reliability constraints pose threat to the device normal operation and accelerate the onset of wearout-based failures. Among various wearout-based failure mechanisms, Negative biased temperature instability (NBTI) has been recognized as the most critical source of device aging. The urge of reliable, low-power circuits is driving the EDA community to develop new design techniques, circuit solutions, algorithms, and software, that can address these critical issues. Unfortunately, this challenge is complicated by the fact that power and reliability are known to be intrinsically conflicting metrics: traditional solutions to improve reliability such as redundancy, increase of voltage levels, and up-sizing of critical devices do contrast with traditional low-power solutions, which rely on compact architectures, scaled supply voltages, and small devices. This dissertation focuses on methodologies to bridge this gap and establishes an important link between low-power solutions and aging effects. More specifically, we proposed new architectural solutions based on power management strategies to enable the design of low-power, aging aware cache memories. Cache memories are one of the most critical components for warranting reliable and timely operation. However, they are also more susceptible to aging effects. Due to symmetric structure of a memory cell, aging occurs regardless of the fact that a cell (or word) is accessed or not. Moreover, aging is a worst-case matric and line with worst-case access pattern determines the aging of the entire cache. In order to stop the aging of a memory cell, it must be put into a proper idle state when a cell (or word) is not accessed which require proper management of the idleness of each atomic unit of power management. We have proposed several reliability management techniques based on the idea of cache partitioning to alleviate NBTI-induced aging and obtain joint energy and lifetime benefits. We introduce graceful degradation mechanism which allows different cache blocks into which a cache is partitioned to age at different rates. This implies that various sub-blocks become unreliable at different times, and the cache keeps functioning with reduced efficiency. We extended the capabilities of this architecture by integrating the concept of reconfigurable caches to maintain the performance of the cache throughout its lifetime. By this strategy, whenever a block becomes unreliable, the remaining cache is reconfigured to work as a smaller size cache with only a marginal degradation of performance. Many mission-critical applications require guaranteed lifetime of their operations and therefore the hardware implementing their functionality. Such constraints are usually enforced by means of various reliability enhancing solutions mostly based on redundancy which are not energy-friendly. In our work, we have proposed a novel cache architecture in which a smart use of cache partitions for redundancy allows us to obtain cache that meet a desired lifetime target with minimal energy consumption', 0, 0, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Many attributes (size, language, testing techniques etc.) probably could have an effect on the quality of software. In this thesis we aim to understand the impact of attributes of three P\'s (people, product, process) on the quality of software by empirical means. Software quality can be interpreted in many ways, such as customer satisfaction, stability and defects etc. In this thesis we adopt ‘defect density\' as a quality measure. Therefore the research focus on the empirical evidences of the impact of attributes of the three P\'s on the software defect density. For this reason empirical research methods (systematic literature reviews, case studies, and interviews) are utilized to collect empirical evidence. Each of this research method helps to extract the empirical evidences of the object under study and for data analysis statistical methods are used. Considering the product attributes, we have studied the size, language, development mode, age, complexity, module structure, module dependency, and module quality and their impact on project quality.

	(2537297, 'Document analysis by means of data mining techniques', '2014', 'thesis', 'TYPES16', 'The huge amount of textual data produced everyday by scientists, journalists and Web users, allows investigating many different aspects of information stored in the published documents. Data mining and information retrieval techniques are exploited to manage and extract information from huge amount of unstructured textual data. Text mining also known as text data mining is the processing of extracting high quality information (focusing relevance, novelty and interestingness) from text by identifying patterns etc. Text mining typically involves the process of structuring input text by means of parsing and other linguistic features or sometimes by removing extra data and then finding patterns from structured data. Patterns are then evaluated at last and interpretation of output is performed to accomplish the desired task. Recently, text mining has got attention in several fields such as in security (involves analysis of Internet news), for commercial (for search and indexing purposes) and in academic departments (such as answering query). Beyond searching the documents consisting the words given in a user query, text mining may provide direct answer to user by semantic web for content based (content meaning and its context). It can also act as intelligence analyst and can also be used in some email spam filters for filtering out unwanted material. Text mining usually includes tasks such as clustering, categorization, sentiment analysis, entity recognition, entity relation modeling and document summarization. In particular, summarization approaches are suitable for identifying relevant sentences that describe the main concepts presented in a document dataset. Furthermore, the knowledge existed in the most informative sentences can be employed to improve the understanding of user and/or community interests. Different approaches have been proposed to extract summaries from unstructured text documents. Some of them are based on the statistical analysis of linguistic features by means of supervised machine learning or data mining methods, such as Hidden Markov models, neural networks and Naive Bayes methods. An appealing research field is the extraction of summaries tailored to the major user interests. In this context, the problem of extracting useful information according to domain knowledge related to the user interests is a challenging task. The main topics have been to study and design of novel data representations and data mining algorithms useful for managing and extracting knowledge from unstructured documents. This thesis describes an effort to investigate the application of data mining approaches, firmly established in the subject of transactional data (e.g., frequent itemset mining), to textual documents. Frequent itemset mining is a widely exploratory technique to discover hidden correlations that frequently occur in the source data. Although its application to transactional data is well-established, the usage of frequent itemsets in textual document summarization has never been investigated so far. A work is carried on exploiting frequent itemsets for the purpose of multi-document summarization so a novel multi-document summarizer, namely ItemSum (Itemset-based Summarizer) is presented, that is based on an itemset-based model, i.e., a framework comprise of frequent itemsets, taken out from the document collection. Highly representative and not redundant sentences are selected for generating summary by considering both sentence coverage, with respect to a sentence relevance score, based on tf-idf statistics, and a concise and highly informative itemset-based model. To evaluate the ItemSum performance a suite of experiments on a collection of news articles has been performed. Obtained results show that ItemSum significantly outperforms mostly used previous summarizers in terms of precision, recall, and F-measure. We also validated our approach against a large number of approaches on the DUC\'04 document collection. Performance comparisons, in terms of precision, recall, and F-measure, have been performed by means of the ROUGE toolkit. In most cases, ItemSum significantly outperforms the considered competitors. Furthermore, the impact of both the main algorithm parameters and the adopted model coverage strategy on the summarization performance are investigated as well. In some cases, the soundness and readability of the generated summaries are unsatisfactory, because the summaries do not cover in an effective way all the semantically relevant data facets. A step beyond towards the generation of more accurate summaries has been made by semantics-based summarizers. Such approaches combine the use of general-purpose summarization strategies with ad-hoc linguistic analysis. The key idea is to also consider the semantics behind the document content to overcome the limitations of general-purpose strategies in differentiating between sentences based on their actual meaning and context. Most of the previously proposed approaches perform the semantics-based analysis as a preprocessing step that precedes the main summarization process. Therefore, the generated summaries could not entirely reflect the actual meaning and context of the key document sentences. In contrast, we aim at tightly integrating the ontology-based document analysis into the summarization process in order to take the semantic meaning of the document content into account during the sentence evaluation and selection processes. With this in mind, we propose a new multi-document summarizer, namely Yago-based Summarizer, that integrates an established ontology-based entity recognition and disambiguation step. Named Entity Recognition from Yago ontology is being used for the task of text summarization. The Named Entity Recognition (NER) task is concerned with marking occurrences of a specific object being mentioned. These mentions are then classified into a set of predefined categories. Standard categories include \\"person\\", \\"location\\", \\"geo-political organization\\", \\"facility\\", \\"organization\\", and \\"time\\". The use of NER in text summarization improved the summarization process by increasing the rank of informative sentences. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we compared its performance on the DUC\'04 benchmark document collections with that of a large number of state-of-the-art summarizers. Furthermore, we also performed a qualitative evaluation of the soundness and readability of the generated summaries and a comparison with the results that were produced by the most effective summarizers. A parallel effort has been devoted to integrating semantics-based models and the knowledge acquired from social networks into a document summarization model named as SociONewSum. The effort addresses the sentence-based generic multi-document summarization problem, which can be formulated as follows: given a collection of news articles ranging over the same topic, the goal is to extract a concise yet informative summary, which consists of most salient document sentences. An established ontological model has been used to improve summarization performance by integrating a textual entity recognition and disambiguation step. Furthermore, the analysis of the user-generated content coming from Twitter has been exploited to discover current social trends and improve the appealing of the generated summaries. An experimental evaluation of the SociONewSum performance was conducted on real English-written news article collections and Twitter posts. The achieved results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed summarizer, in terms of different ROUGE scores, compared to state-of-the-art open source summarizers as well as to a baseline version of the SociONewSum summarizer that does not perform any UGC analysis. Furthermore, the readability of the generated summaries has also been analyzed', 0, 0, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

It is time for the industry to explore novel material based devices that support future integrated circuits. Graphene is a two dimensional material which can be patterned through existing lithography process, therefore representing the most interesting material for concurrent, single-layer integration of devices and interconnects. Moreover, it shows unique mechanical properties alowing for the growth of new smart devices (e.g. wearable computing). In this dissertation, we focus on a novel device called as multi function reconfigurable gate proposed by IBM. This device consists of coplanar split gates underneath a large graphene sheet. A thin dielectric oxide layer separates the gates and the graphene sheet. Three metal-graphene contacts are present on top of the graphene sheet, called as front metal-graphene contacts. The co-planar gates dope the graphene electrostatically by using bipolar voltages. Here, we define logic ‘0\' as negative voltage (-Vdd/2) and logic ‘1\' (+Vdd/2) as positive voltage. The gates are connected to ‘0\' and ‘1\' making the graphene region above the gates p-type and n-type, respectively. The device do not rely on patterning the graphene sheet into nanoribbons. Advanced CMOS lithography techniques can be efficiently used for the gate patterning to achieve high density integration. Thus, this device is feasible for manufacturing and does not introduce any edge effects on the carriers. Using the above mentioned multi function reconfigurable gate, with appropriate terminal connections, a graphene 2:1 multiplexer is realized. An equivalent electrical model (also verilog-A model) is developed which is integrated with commercial SPICE simulators. With appropriate signals at the data inputs of the graphene 2:1 multiplexer, several other basic boolean logic gates (Inv, AND, OR etc) are realized. Some of these gates (like AND etc) have multiple architectures and a thorough comparison in terms of power and performance is presented. For the graphene reconfigurable gate based logic gates, we identify the possible timing arcs. The timing arc is defined from the input node to the output node. Only those input node which is responsible for a signal transition at the output terminal are considered. Two classes of timing arcs are identified, one from back gate terminals to output terminal termed as back-to-out transition, second from front contact terminal to the output terminal termed as front-to-out transition. An analytical model for delay and power for each of these timing arcs are presented and validated through SPICE simulator. The model validation is done for a range of input transition time and output load capacitance. The next step is to build integrated circuits with these graphene based gates. This is termed as synthesis and is present in the initial stage of the traditional IC design flow. There are various synthesis methods for designing conventional CMOS based circuits. These methods (namely Standard Cell Mapping (STC), Binary Decision Diagrams (BDD) and Look Up Table (LUT)) can be adopted for graphene RG based gates too. Various benchmark circuits implemented with these methods are characterized for power, area and performance. This helps designers in identifying the best implementation style for low power and high performance circuit. From testability perspective, the effect of various physical defects such as Short circuit between device terminals and open terminals on the graphene RG based logic gates is presented in this thesis. The electrical behavior of faulty devices, obtained through the emulation of physical failures at the SPICE-level, have been analyzed and mapped at a higher level of abstraction using proper fault models. Finally, in this thesis we propose ultra low power graphene logic gates, based on Adiabatic Computing. We design graphene pn-junction based adiabatic logic gates (INV/AND/OR) and are characterized for power and performance.

However, avionics full-duplex switched Ethernet does not eliminate contentions at network switches, which may result in an uncontrolled increase in end-to-end latencies, and hence limit the potential of this technology. The use of time to pace packet transmission and forwarding (that is, the adoption of pipeline forwarding) has been demonstrated to avoid contentions at switching nodes in wide-area communication networks, thus being potentially attractive also for avionics networks in general, and avionics full-duplex switched Ethernet in particular. However, questions might arise concerning the actual feasibility of such an approach in the avionics domain due to the possibly high costs required to deploy packet switches able to operate according to a very precise time schedule, which is necessary to respect the stringent delivery deadlines of avionics systems.

Although recent years have witnessed technological advancements, the availability of technology does not ensure accessibility to information and communication technologies (ICT). Extensive use of text from menus to document contents means that deaf or functionally illiterate can not access services implemented on most computer software. Consequently, most existing computer applications pose an accessibility barrier to those who are unable to read fluently. Online technologies intended for such groups should be developed in continuous partnership with primary users and include a thorough investigation into their limitations, requirements and usability barriers. In this research, I investigated existing tools in voice, web and other multimedia technologies to identify learning gaps and explored ways to enhance the information literacy for deaf and functionally illiterate users. I worked on the development of user-centered interfaces to increase the capabilities of deaf and low literacy users by enhancing lexical resources and by evaluating several multimedia interfaces for them. The interface of the platform-independent Italian Sign Language (LIS) Dictionary has been developed to enhance the lexical resources for deaf users. The Sign Language Dictionary accepts Italian lemmas as input and provides their representation in the Italian Sign Language as output. The Sign Language dictionary has 3082 signs as set of Avatar animations in which each sign is linked to a corresponding Italian lemma. I integrated the LIS lexical resources with MultiWordNet (MWN) database to form the first LIS MultiWordNet(LMWN). LMWN contains information about lexical relations between words, semantic relations between lexical concepts (synsets), correspondences between Italian and sign language lexical concepts and semantic fields (domains). The approach enhances the deaf users\' understanding of written Italian language and shows that a relatively small set of lexicon can cover a significant portion of MWN. Integration of LIS signs with MWN made it useful tool for computational linguistics and natural language processing. The rule-based translation process from written Italian text to LIS has been transformed into service-oriented system. The translation process is composed of various modules including parser, semantic interpreter, generator, and spatial allocation planner. This translation procedure has been implemented in the Java Application Building Center (jABC), which is a framework for extreme model driven design (XMDD). The XMDD approach focuses on bringing software development closer to conceptual design, so that the functionality of a software solution could be understood by someone who is unfamiliar with programming concepts. The transformation addresses the heterogeneity challenge and enhances the re-usability of the system. For enhancing the e-participation of functionally illiterate users, two detailed studies were conducted in the Republic of Rwanda. In the first study, the traditional (textual) interface was compared with the virtual character-based interactive interface. The study helped to identify usability barriers and users evaluated these interfaces according to three fundamental areas of usability, i.e. effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. In another study, we developed four different interfaces to analyze the usability and effects of online assistance (consistent help) for functionally illiterate users and compared different help modes including textual, vocal and virtual character on the performance of semi-literate users. In our newly designed interfaces the instructions were automatically translated in Swahili language. All the interfaces were evaluated on the basis of task accomplishment, time consumption, System Usability Scale (SUS) rating and number of times the help was acquired. The results show that the performance of semi-literate users improved significantly when using the online assistance. The dissertation thus introduces a new development approach in which virtual characters are used as additional support for barely literate or naturally challenged users. Such components enhanced the application utility by offering a variety of services like translating contents in local language, providing additional vocal information, and performing automatic translation from text to sign language. Obviously, there is no such thing as one design solution that fits for all in the underlying domain. Context sensitivity, literacy and mental abilities are key factors on which I concentrated and the results emphasize that computer interfaces must be based on a thoughtful definition of target groups, purposes and objectives', 0, 0, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

The UAV technology is an active area of academic research due to the challenges related to aerodynamics, tight power and payload budgets, multi-sensor information fusion, reactive real-time path planning, perception and communication bandwidth requirements. Autonomous navigation is a complex problem due to the challenges of algorithmic complexity and their real-time implementation. The challenges like long-term GPS errors/outage/jamming and exponential error growth in inertial sensors increase the complexity of autonomous navigation to an extent that high level of redundancy is mandatory in the design of navigation systems. Typical UAV systems use multi-sensor (GPS + INS +Vision) data fusion coupled with responsive sensors, innovative navigation algorithms, computationally capable onboard computers and reactive electromechanical systems to accomplish the navigational needs of safe operations in urban environments. Machine learning is a very promising technology and has broad applicability in the many real-life problems: ranging from hand-held & wearable computers to intelligent cars and homes. It can be efficiently used in autonomous navigation of UAVs. This work presents a novel absolute position estimation solution that leverages Radial Basis Function (RBF) classifier for robust aerial image registration. The proposed solution covers the entire spectrum of the problem involving algorithm design, hardware architecture and real-time hardware implementation. The system relies on single passive imaging source for acquisition of aerial images. The sensed image is geometrically transformed to bring it in a common view point as the reference satellite image. The orthorectified aerial image is then learned by the RBF network and full search is performed in the Region of Interest (ROI) of the reference satellite image. The real-time implementation of computationally intensive algorithm is accomplished by designing a customized wide data path in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The proposed architecture offers a reliable drift-free position estimation solution by conglomerating information from the inertial sensors and geo-registration of the aerial images over a geodetically aligned satellite reference image. We compare the robustness of our proposed matching algorithm with the standard normalized area correlation techniques and present limitations and False Acceptance Rates (FAR) of the two algorithms.

Several different network models can be created, depending on the type of interactions that need to be investigated. Gene Regulatory Networks (GRN) are an effective model commonly used to study the complex regulatory mechanisms of a cell. Unfortunately, given their intrinsic complexity and non discrete nature, the computational study of realistic-sized complex GRNs requires some abstractions. Boolean Networks (BNs), for example, are a reliable model that can be used to represent networks where the possible state of a node is a boolean value (0 or 1). Despite this strong simplification, BNs have been used to study both structural and dynamic properties of real as well as randomly generated GRNs. Results: In this paper we show how it is possible to include the post-transcriptional regulation mechanism (a key process mediated by small non-coding RNA molecules like the miRNAs) into the BN model of a GRN. The enhanced BN model is implemented in a software toolkit (EBNT) that allows to analyze boolean GRNs from both a structural and a dynamic point of view. The open-source toolkit is compatible with available visualization tools like Cytoscape and allows to run detailed analysis of the network topology as well as of its attractors, trajectories, and state-space. In the paper, a small GRN built around the mTOR gene is used to demonstrate the main capabilities of the toolkit. Conclusions: The extended model proposed in this paper opens new opportunities in the study of gene regulation. Several of the successful researches done with the support of BN to understand high-level characteristics of regulatory networks, can now be improved to better understand the role of post-transcriptional regulation for example as a network-wide noise-reduction or stabilization mechanisms', 1, 3, 1, 6, '1742-4682', NULL, 'BioMed Central', NULL, NULL, 'THEORETICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICAL MODELLING', '10.1186/1742-4682-11-S1-S5'),

The potential value of such a variable for obtaining significant improvements over current stability control systems is widely recognized. However, its direct measurement requires the use of complex and expensive devices which cannot be used in production cars. Large research efforts has been devoted to the problem of estimating the sideslip angle from other variables currently measured by standard Electronic Stability Control (ESC) sensors. However, at the best of author\'s knowledge, until now no application to production cars is known. In this paper, a new sideslip angle estimation technology is presented. Based on the innovative DVS methodology recently developed by the authors, a software algorithm, indicated as DVS/SA (Direct Virtual Sensor of Sideslip Angle), is designed, which estimates the sideslip angle from measurements of the yaw rate, lateral and longitudinal acceleration, wheel speed, steering angle, available from ESC sensors of most present production cars. The key innovative idea of the technology is that the DVS/SA is directly designed from the experimental data collected from a testing car, subject to suitable manoeuvres in different road and load conditions. One of the distinctive features obtained by this new approach is that good estimation accuracy is achieved even for quite large operating condition variations, e.g. dry or wet road, different tire status, etc. The effectiveness of the DVS/SA technology is evidenced not only by the experimental results presented in the paper but also from the fact that it is has been recently made available on a top class car', 0, 0, 1, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'SAE 2014 World Congress & Exhibition', 'SAE Technical Paper 2014-01-0084', NULL, '10.4271/2014-01-0084'),

Analysis ofTwitter data imposes new challenges because the data distribution is intrinsically sparse, due to a large number of messages post every day by using a wide vocabulary. Aimed at addressing this issue, generalized itemsets - sets of items at different abstraction levels - can be effectively mined and used todiscover interesting multiple-level correlations among data supplied with taxonomies. Each generalizeditemset is characterized by a correlation type (positive, negative, or null) according to the strength of thecorrelation among its items.This paper presents a novel data mining approach to supporting different and interesting targetedanalysis - topic trend analysis, context-aware service profiling - by analyzing Twitter posts. We aim atdiscovering contrasting situations by means of generalized itemsets. Specifically, we focus on comparingitemsets discovered at different abstraction levels and we select large subsets of specific (descendant)itemsets that show correlation type changes with respect to their common ancestor.

To maintain the in-order instructions commitment and to guarantee the correctness of the final results (as well as precise exception management), the Reorder Buffer (ROB) is used. From the architectural point of view, the ROB is a memory array of several thousands of bits that must be tested against hardware faults to ensure a correct behavior of the processor. Since it is deeply embedded within the microprocessor circuitry, the most straightforward approach to test the ROB is through Built-In Self-Test solutions, which are typically adopted by manufacturers for end-of-production test. However, these solutions may not always be used for the test during the operational phase (in-field test) which aims at detecting possible hardware faults arising when the electronic systems works in its target environment. In fact, these solutions require the usage of test infrastructures that may not be accessible and/or documented, or simply not usable during the operational phase. This paper proposes an alternative solution, based on a functional approach, in which the test is performed by forcing the processor to execute a specially written test program, and checking the behavior of the processor.

Both control algorithms are designed and implemented around an internal model which includes a disturbance dynamics, capable of encoding external disturbances and model discrepancies. Both schemes appear to be an extension of the internal model control (IMC). The disturbance dynamics is driven by the so-called uncertainty input signals (briefly noise) that are real-time estimated by an observer feedback (uncertainty estimator) driven by the model error: plant output minus model output. The main advantage of ADRC and EMC is that the estimated disturbance contains the past uncertainty that now enters both the internal model and the control law as a signal, and allows the rest of the control law (state feedback) to be designed model-based, not depending on the uncertainty. The main difference between ADRC and EMC is that the former assumes that model errors can be treated like input disturbances, whereas EMC shows that high-frequency neglected dynamics cannot be treated as such. The former standpoint does not place any limitation to the control bandwidth (BW), unlike the latter one which is compelled to find out an optimal BW in the presence of uncertainty.

We formulate the passivity constraints as a unity boundedness condition on the H∞ norm of the system transfer function. When this condition is not verified, we use it as an explicit constraint within an iterative perturbation loop of the system state-space matrices. Since the resulting optimization framework is convex but non-smooth, we solve it via localization based algorithms, such as the ellipsoid and the cutting plane methods. Such methods are guaranteed to converge to the global optimum, namely the passive system that is closest to the original system in a suitable system norm. We provide a systematic way of initializing the localization methods by defining an initial feasible set that is guaranteed to contain the optimal solution. Also, we provide a lower bound for the cost function, which becomes tighter at each iteration, allowing to bracket the global optimum within a prescribed accuracy threshold. The proposed technique solves two critical bottleneck issues of the existing approaches for passivity enforcement of linear macromodels.

However, while quite a vast literature exists on GP-based design, very few contributions can yet be found on the problem of identifying posynomial models from experimental data. Posynomial identification amounts to determining not only the coefficients of the combination, but also the exponents in the monomials, which renders the identification problem numerically hard. In this paper, we outline an approach to the identification of both multivariate polynomial and posynomial models, based on the expansion on a given large-scale basis of monomials.

This work proposes an algorithm to optimize multiple Quality of Service indices of Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) IP networks. Such an approach aims at minimizing the network cost and the amount of simultaneous requests rejection, as well as performing load balancing among routes.

Pareto-fronts obtained by VN-MGA dominate fronts obtained by fixed-neighborhood encoding schemes.

We recently presented an efficient approach for training a Pairwise Support Vector Machine (PSVM) with a suitable kernel for i-vector pairs for a quite large speaker recognition task. Rather than estimating an SVM model per speaker, according to the \\"one versus all\\" discriminative paradigm, the PSVM approach classifies a trial, consisting of a pair of i-vectors, as belonging or not to the same speaker class. Training a PSVM with large amount of data, however, is a memory and computational expensive task, because the number of training pairs grows quadratically with the number of training i-vectors. This paper demonstrates that a very small subset of the training pairs is necessary to train the original PSVM model, and proposes two approaches that allow discarding most of the training pairs that are not essential, without harming the accuracy of the model. This allows dramatically reducing the memory and computational resources needed for training, which becomes feasible with large datasets including many speakers.

CL faces a relevant degree of complexity due to the characteristics of modern urban areas, such as traffic congestion, lack of parking spaces, high levels of pollution, and restrictions imposed by local regulations. This environment causes uncertainty about planning and managing delivery activities so that, if not properly organized, urban logistics might not meet its goals. In recent years, many models have been developed to optimize the CL process considering the perspectives of the different stakeholders involved. Studies mainly focus on the location and role of distribution warehouses, freight flows, the routing task, vehicle loading, the size and type of vehicles that can enter urban areas, and possible charges for accessing city centers. However, a successful implementation of such models requires internal efficiency by each actor. In this context, a crucial role is played by logistics service providers (LSPs) because they are expected to offer high quality services in congested urban areas and the effectiveness of their activities depends on the interactions among all the CL stakeholders. The paper proposes an empirical analysis on the operational factors determining the level of efficiency of a LSP.

Data about a LSP involved in urban freight distribution in Italy are analyzed and a regression analysis is completed. Results highlight that two managerial levers affect the level of productivity. The first one is related to the organization of the distribution network: a more efficient location of warehouses, an extension of the area covered by each driver and a more efficient routing structure can significantly increase the productivity of a LSP. At the same time, the vehicle loading strategy appears to be crucial: as a matter of fact, vehicles should not be excessively loaded, especially with big parcels, so that the business can be performed more efficiently. This study represents an attempt to develop a comprehensive panel of operational variables that support the efficiency of the urban distribution system of LSPs. The potential benefits associated with the enhancement of efficiency are both economic and environmental', 1, 0, 1, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, '17th meeting of the EURO WORKING GROUP ON TRANSPORTATION (EWGT) 2014', 'EWGT 2014 BOOK OF ABSTRACTS', NULL, NULL),

Triple Modular Redundancy is a widely used fault tolerance methodology to protect circuits against radiation-induced Single Event Upsets implemented on SRAM-based FPGAs. The accumulation of SEUs in the configuration memory can cause the TMR replicas to fail, requiring a periodic write-back of the configuration bit-stream. The associated system downtime due to scrubbing and the probability of simultaneous failures of two TMR domains are increasing with growing device densities. We propose a methodology to reduce the recovery time of TMR circuits with increased resilience to Cross-Domain Errors.

The fine-grain error detection logic identifies the faulty domain using gate-level functions while the error flag convergence logic reduces the overwhelming number of flag signals. The non-overlapping placement enables selective domain reconfiguration and greatly reduces the number of Cross-Domain Errors. Our results demonstrate an evident reduction of the recovery time due to fast error detection time and selective partial reconfiguration of faulty domains.

Terrestrial safety-critical applications based on newer nano-scale technologies raise increasing concerns about transient errors induced by neutrons. Therefore, techniques to effectively estimate and improve the reliability of VLIW processors are of great interest. In this paper, we present a novel technique aimed to further improve the efficiency of the Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) hardening-technique applied at the software level on VLIW processors. In particular, we first experimentally demonstrate that the TMR-based software technique, when applied at the C code level, is not able to cope with most of the failures affecting user logic resources. Then, we propose a method able to analyze and modify the TMR-based code for a generic VLIW processor in order to improve the fault tolerance of the executed application without modifying the VLIW processor. In details, the proposed technique is able to reduce the number of cross-domain errors affecting the TMR-hardened code of a VLIW processor data path.

To provide groundwork for comparison, a more formal framework of multi-scale orientation estimation, based on scale-space axioms, in spatial domain is presented.

This is opposed to only one linear combination across the scales, used in simple spatial domain techniques. Further more, the DFB-based Fourier domain approach extracts the best local orientation by comparing and contrasting all possible orientations with their respective strength measures. The strength measure used in Fourier method is based on local variance, free from inaccurate gradient calculation. Simulations are conducted over noisy test images as well as real fingerprints. Our objective results indicate that multi-scale Fourier domain approach always yields better estimates at variable level of noise as compared to stand alone multi-scale spatial domain approaches.

A substantial number of these devices run on the Android operating system. Android is an open-source operating system based on Linux, which provides a permission-based security model that demands each application to request explicit permissions (approved by the user) before it can be installed to run. However, end users cannot estimate application risk, so the user\'s decision is almost completely unrelated to the application risk level. Moreover, due to the platform openness and the plethora of available software, dangerous apps (even if not necessarily malware) are now also very common for Android devices.

The tool exploits both static and dynamic analysis techniques. It examines the correlations between app required permissions and the invoked APIs, as well as the contents in the package, and subsequently it uses a dynamic analysis module to confirm the suspicions proposed by static modules. The risk activities detected by analysis modules are then mapped into finer-grained risk categories and further evaluated using the fuzzy logic algorithm. Fuzzy logic aims to deal with uncertainty which arises from the nature of automatic analysis, as not all detected activities intend to cause harm.

The objective is to design a dynamic fixed-order controller in order to constrain the coefficients of the closed-loop characteristic polynomial within prescribed intervals. First, necessary conditions on the plant parameters for the existence of a robust controller are reviewed, and it is shown that such conditions are satisfied if and only if a suitable Sylvester matrix is nonsingular for all possible values of the uncertain plant parameters. The problem of checking such a robust nonsingularity condition is formulated in terms of a nonconvex optimization problem. Then, the set of all feasible robust controllers is sought through the solution to a suitable robust diophantine equation.

Despite post transcriptional regulatory elements (i.e., miRNAs) are widely investigated in current research, their usage and visualization in biological networks is very limited. Regulatory networks are commonly limited to gene entities. To integrate networks with post transcriptional regulatory data, researchers are therefore forced to manually resort to specific third party databases. In this context, we introduce ReNE, a Cytoscape 3.x plugin designed to automatically enrich a standard gene-based regulatory network with more detailed transcriptional, post transcriptional, and translational data, resulting in an enhanced network that more precisely models the actual biological regulatory mechanisms. ReNE can automatically import a network layout from the Reactome or KEGG repositories, or work with custom pathways described using a standard OWL/XML data format that the Cytoscape import procedure accepts. Moreover, ReNE allows researchers to merge multiple pathways coming from different sources. The merged network structure is normalized to guarantee a consistent and uniform description of the network nodes and edges and to enrich all integrated data with additional annotations retrieved from genome-wide databases like NCBI, thus producing a pathway fully manageable through the Cytoscape environment. The normalized network is then analyzed to include missing transcription factors, miRNAs, and proteins. The resulting enhanced network is still a fully functional Cytoscape network where each regulatory element (transcription factor, miRNA, gene, protein) and regulatory mechanism (up-regulation/down-regulation) is clearly visually identifiable, thus enabling a better visual understanding of its role and the effect in the network behavior. The enhanced network produced by ReNE is exportable in multiple formats for further analysis via third party applications.

To uncover the mechanisms leading to high-grade ALCL, we developed a human patient-derived tumorgraft (hPDT) line. Molecular characterization of primary and PDT cells demonstrated the activation of ALK and nuclear factor kB (NFkB) pathways. Genomic studies of ALCL-11 showed the TP53 loss and the in vivo subclonal expansion of lymphoma cells, lacking PRDM1/Blimp1 and carrying c-MYC gene amplification. The treatment with proteasome inhibitors of TRAF1-ALK cells led to the downregulation of p50/p52 and lymphoma growth inhibition.

The GPUs though originally were designed for rendering graphics in high resolution games, are now a days extensively used for computation intensive general purpose applications by the name GPGPU (General Purpose Graphic Processing Unit). Various programming tools and APIs have been developed for GPU computing with greater attention received by CUDA, OpenCL and OpenGL. This work uses OpenCL as parallel programming tool because of its open standard and heterogeneity. GPU Computing power has been exploited in running various applications such as sorting large data sets, design and implementation of parallel FFT library and the FFT based fast Magnetostatic field computation in the area of Micromagnetics. Sorting algorithms arrange a given sequence of input data into a certain order (monotonic increase or decrease) and are categorized by their computational complexity for best, average and worst case analysis. The time complexity is not the only deciding parameter, but other factors like stability, robustness, scalability, input distribution, memory storage and access patterns decide the applicability of a sorting algorithm for a certain application domain.

The novel sorting technique, Butterfly Network Sort, exploit high parallelism in its design and thus achieve considerable speedup against state-of-the-art sorting techniques. Fast Fourier Transforms library (named ToPe-FFT) is implemented using OpenCL. ToPe-FFT is based on the well-known Cooley-Tukey algorithm with auto-tuning for multiple GPUs. The open source ToPe-FFT implements several base radices along side the support for mixed-radices making it an almost arbitrary length FFT library. The library takes Complex-to-Complex (C2C) input type with dimension sizes up-to 3D. The design and interface of ToPe-FFT is similar to cuFFT and FFTW. The supported features of arbitrary input length, better accuracy in high dimension transforms, load balancing on multiple GPUs and above all significant speedup against cuFFT and FFTW makes ToPe-FFT promising in delivering maximum performance.

Therefore, safety-critical applications should consider dependability from design, implementation, layout, fabrication to in-field operations.

Information can be gathered either from multiple data sources or through the use of multiple representations generated from a single data source. A single representation summarizes the information and provides a single cue on the data, and thus may not be able to fully reveal the inherent characteristics of the data. In visual recognition, image representations are generally categorized into global and local based types. A global representation captures features corresponds to some holistic characteristic in the image, and produces a coarse representation. Differently, a local representation reveals detail variations and traits inherent to the image. Psychological findings have shown that humans equally rely on both local and global visual information. Moreover, there is a large agreement in literature that the combination of different features, i.e. a multiview perspective, can have a positive effect on the performance of a pattern recognition system. In fact, different features can represent different and complementary characteristics of the data; in other words, each feature set represent a different view on the original dataset. Thus it is expected that a visual recognition system can benefit from different representations (both local and global) through the use of information fusion. Information can generally be consolidated at three different levels: (i) decision level; (ii) match score level; and (iii) feature level. In the literature match level and decision level fusion (i.e. combining the output of different classifier, each of them working on different feature sets) have been extensively studied, whereas feature level fusion is a relatively understudied problem because of the difficulties inherent to its correct implementation. Feature level fusion may incorporate redundant, noisy or trivial information and the concatenated feature vectors may lead to the problem of curse of dimensionality. In addition, the feature sets may not be compatible and relationship between different feature spaces may not be known. Moreover, this integration comes at a cost, which may incur in units of time, computational resources or even money. Nevertheless, it is thought that fusing features at this level would still retain a richer source of discriminative information. Motivated by the belief, this thesis investigates the use of feature level fusion and its correlation with feature selection and classification tasks for two recent pattern recognition problems. These include the classification of six types of HEp2 staining patterns and the automatic verification of kinship relations in a pair of face images. several image attributes are proposed, that are better capable of characterizing the different kind of images associated with the two said classification tasks. Feature level fusion of the different attributes is performed followed by a careful reduction of features, through the use of pertinent feature selection and classification algorithms, that decide the most representative and discriminative feature sets for the patterns to classify.

This wide distribution is mainly due to the miniaturization surrounded by an increasing computing power of semiconductor devices. However, there are many complex and arduous challenges associated to this phenomenon. One of these challenges is the reliability of electronic systems. Nowadays, several research e↵orts are aimed at improving the semiconductors reliability. Manufacturing processes, aging phenomena of components and environmental stress may cause internal permanent defects and damages during the lifetime of a device; in the other side, the environment in which these devices are employed could introduce soft errors (i.e., errors that do not damage the device but a data during the computation) in their internal circuitry, thus compromising the correct behavior of the whole system. Consequently, in order to guarantee product quality and consumer satisfaction, it is necessary to discover faults as soon as possible (both, in the manufacturing process and during the devices lifetime); moreover, it is equally important to provide the electronic systems with fault tolerance equipments aimed to assure a correct functioning in every condition. Despite the reliability requirements, modern electronic systems require also an increasing computational power to satisfy the customers needs. In order to face to this demand, in the last two decades di↵erent powerful computational devices have been designed and developed. They are mainly based on architectures allowing the execution of multiple computations in parallel at the same time. Among the others, the Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) processors are a particular type of multicore and reconfigurable processors; they have been developed to perform several operations in parallel, where the scheduling of the operations themselves is completely demanded at the compiler: VLIWs are suitable for systems requiring high computational performance maintaining a reduced power consumption. Another interesting type of multicore computational units are the General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs): their very high computational power, combined with low cost, reduced power consumption, and flexible development platforms are pushing their adoption not only for graphical applications, but also in the High Performance Computing (HPC) market and in embedded devices. Moreover, GPGPUs are increasingly used in some safety-critical embedded domains, such as automotive, avionics, space and biomedical. The main in common feature of VLIWs and GPGPUs is that they can be used in a System-on-Chip (SoC) as computational co-processors: in a typical SoC, in fact, the main Central Processing Unit (CPU) is in charge of demand and supervise the execution of data intensive operations to these architectures; in this way, the workload of the CPU itself is lower. As an example, in the NASA labs, VLIWs have been evaluated to efficiently perform image analysis on board a Mars rover for future space missions, while the main CPU of the system is available to perform other realtime control operations. In the other hand, the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADASs) which are increasingly common in cars, uses GPGPUs or GPGPU-like devices to analyze images (or radar signals) coming from external cameras and sensors to detect possible obstacles, requiring the automatic intervention of the breaking system. In this PhD thesis, several new techniques have been developed with the common goal of improving the reliability characteristics of multicore processing units. More in particular, considering VLIW processors, new test and diagnostic methods have been studied and implemented in order to detect permanent faults; they are mainly based on the Software-Based Self-Test (SBST) technique. The final goal is to reduce the time required to perform the test of a generic VLIW processor, and to efficiently localize the faulty module. On the other hand, the present dissertation focus on the e↵ects introduced by soft errors in GPGPU devices; this works have been done through the execution of several neutron radiation tests. At the end of these analysis, new techniques finalized to the fault tolerance enhancement of GPGPU applications have been proposed. As industrial case, the validation of a programmable timing multicore co-processor module (i.e., the Generic Timer Module manufactured by Bosch) used in the today automotive Electronic Control Units (ECUs) has been designed and implemented. More in particular, an FPGA-based validation platform has been developed, where one of its main feature is the ability to efficiently verify the behavior of the module under test, thus ensuring a correct implementation of the software running on it.

To this aim, research activities were carried out based on a widespread real-time communication protocol, namely, the Controller Area Network (CAN). Indeed, CAN is the de facto standard in automotive and more recently, it also gained popularity in industrial automation and various kinds of networked embedded systems. Determinism is of paramount importance in communication, since it directly affects timing accuracy. However, deterministic communication cannot be achieved without a comprehensive understanding of possible sources of delay and jitter in a CAN-based distributed system, and more importantly, their countermeasures. Even if all the other sources of jitter are removed or mitigated, the bit stuffing (BS) mechanism the CAN physical layer relies on still introduces a non-negligible amount of variability into the frame transmission time. To solve this problem, first of all, two novel encoding schemes, namely 8B9B and VHCC, were designed and implemented to prevent bit stuffing in the CAN payload. More specifically, VHCC enhanced the fixed length 8B9B payload encoding in terms of encoding efficiency by means of packing sub-byte information. After that, a Zero Stuff-bits CRC (ZSC) mechanism was invented to tackle remaining bit stuffing jitter in the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) of a CAN frame. In this way, it is possible to eliminate bit stuffing jitter completely from all over the frame and achieve jitterless CAN communication. Concerning this activity, an Italian patent application has been submitted and a European extension is under preparation. For what concerns flexible communication, we extended CAN in both the real-time and non real-time domains. On the one hand, the application scenarios of CAN were largely broadened by making it support the most widely used general-purpose communication protocol, namely the Internet Protocol (IP). On the other hand, in the real-time domain, a transport protocol was designed and implemented to support Modbus on CAN. Modbus is an application layer real-time communication protocol widespread in industrial and building automation. This work was adopted by industry for local subsystem communication. And more importantly, it paves the way for CAN in building automation.

	(2596359, 'Stochastic programming for City Logistics: new models and methods', '2015', 'thesis', 'TYPES16', 'The need for mobility that emerged in the last decades led to an impressive increase in the number of vehicles as well as to a saturation of transportation infrastructures. Consequently, traffic congestion, accidents, transportation delays, and polluting emissions are some of the most recurrent concerns transportation and city managers have to deal with. However, just building new infrastructures might be not sustainable because of their cost, the land usage, which usually lacks in metropolitan regions, and their negative impact on the environment. Therefore, a different way of improving the performance of transportation systems while enhancing travel safety has to be found in order to make people and good transportation operations more efficient and support their key role in the economic development of either a city or a whole country. The concept of City Logistics (CL) is being developed to answer to this need. Indeed, CL focus on reducing the number of vehicles operating in the city, controlling their dimension and characteristics. CL solutions do not only improve the transportation system but the whole logistics system within an urban area, trying to integrate interests of the several. This global view challenges researchers to develop planning models, methods and decision support tools for the optimization of the structures and the activities of the transportation system. In particular, this leads researchers to the definition of strategic and tactical problems belonging to well-known problem classes, including network design problem, vehicle routing problem (VRP), traveling salesman problem (TSP), bin packing problem (BPP), which typically act as sub-problems of the overall CL system optimization. When long planning horizons are involved, these problems become stochastic and, thus, must explicitly take into account the different sources of uncertainty that can affect the transportation system. Due to these reasons and the large-scale of CL systems, the optimization problems arising in the urban context are very challenging. Their solution requires investigations in mathematical and combinatorial optimization methods as well as the implementation of efficient exact and heuristic algorithms. However, contributions answering these challenges are still limited number. This work contributes in filling this gap in the literature in terms of both modeling framework for new planning problems in CL context and developing new and effective heuristic solving methods for the two-stage formulation of these problems. Three stochastic problems are proposed in the context of CL: the stochastic variable cost and size bin packing problem (SVCSBPP), the multi-handler knapsack problem under uncertainty (MHKPu) and the multi-path traveling salesman problem with stochastic travel times (mpTSPs). The SVCSBPP arises in supply-chain management, in which companies outsource the logistics activities to a third-party logistic firm (3PL). The procurement of sufficient capacity, expressed in terms of vehicles, containers or space in a warehouse for varying periods of time to satisfy the demand plays a crucial role. The SVCSBPP focuses on the relation between a company and its logistics capacity provider and the tactical-planning problem of determining the quantity of capacity units to secure for the next period of activity. The SVCSBPP is the first attempt to introduce a stochastic variant of the variable cost and size bin packing problem (VCSBPP) considering not only the uncertainty on the demand to deliver, but also on the renting cost of the different bins and their availability. A large number of real-life situations can be satisfactorily modeled as a MHKPu, in particular in the last mile delivery. Last mile delivery may involve different sequences of consolidation operations, each handled by different workers with different skill levels and reliability. The improper management of consolidation operations can cause delay in the operations reducing the overall profit of the deliveries. Thus, given a set of potential logistics handlers and a set of items to deliver, characterized by volume and random profit, the MHKPu consists in finding a subset of items which maximizes the expected total profit. The profit is given by the sum of a deterministic profit and a stochastic profit oscillation, with unknown probability distribution, due to the random handling costs of the handlers.The mpTSPs arises mainly in City Logistics applications. Cities offer several services, such as garbage collection, periodic delivery of goods in urban grocery distribution and bike sharing services. These services require the planning of fixed and periodic tours that will be used from one to several weeks. However, the enlarged time horizon as well as strong dynamic changes in travel times due to traffic congestion and other nuisances typical of the urban transportation induce the presence of multiple paths with stochastic travel times. Given a graph characterized by a set of nodes connected by arcs, mpTSPs considers that, for every pair of nodes, multiple paths between the two nodes are present. Each path is characterized by a random travel time. Similarly to the standard TSP, the aim of the problem is to define the Hamiltonian cycle minimizing the expected total cost. These planning problems have been formulated as two-stage integer stochastic programs with recourse. Discretization methods are usually applied to approximate the probability distribution of the random parameters. The resulting approximated program becomes a deterministic linear program with integer decision variables of generally very large dimensions, beyond the reach of exact methods. Therefore, heuristics are required. For the MHKPu, we apply the extreme value theory and derive a deterministic approximation, while for the SVCSBPP and the mpTSPs we introduce effective and accurate heuristics based on the progressive hedging (PH) ideas. The PH mitigates the computational difficulty associated with large problem instances by decomposing the stochastic program by scenario. When effective heuristic techniques exist for solving individual scenario, that is the case of the SVCSBPP and the mpTSPs, the PH further reduces the computational effort of solving scenario subproblems by means of a commercial solver. In particular, we propose a series of specific strategies to accelerate the search and efficiently address the symmetry of solutions, including an aggregated consensual solution, heuristic penalty adjustments, and a bundle fixing technique. Yet, although solution methods become more powerful, combinatorial problems in the CL context are very large and difficult to solve. Thus, in order to significantly enhance the computational efficiency, these heuristics implement parallel schemes. With the aim to make a complete analysis of the problems proposed, we perform extensive numerical experiments on a large set of instances of various dimensions, including realistic setting derived by real applications in the urban area, and combinations of different levels of variability and correlations in the stochastic parameters. The campaign includes the assessment of the efficiency of the meta-heuristic, the evaluation of the interest to explicitly consider uncertainty, an analysis of the impact of problem characteristics, the structure of solutions, as well as an evaluation of the robustness of the solutions when used as decision tool. The numerical analysis indicates that the stochastic programs have significant effects in terms of both the economic impact (e.g. cost reduction) and the operations management (e.g. prediction of the capacity needed by the firm). The proposed methodologies outperform the use of commercial solvers, also when small-size instances are considered. In fact, they find good solutions in manageable computing time. This makes these heuristics a strategic tool that can be incorporated in larger decision support systems for CL', 0, 0, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '10.6092/polito/porto/2596359'),
	(2597354, 'Integration-aware Modeling, Simulation and Design Techniques for Smart Electronic Systems', '2015', 'thesis', 'TYPES16', 'Smart electronic systems represent a vast category of energy-autonomous and ubiquitously connected systems that incorporate analog, digital and MEMS components, combined with various kinds of sensors, actuators, energy storage devices and power sources. Smart systems generally find applications in the worldwide market for \\"Monitoring & Control\\" products and solutions, hence they are used in a broad range of sectors, including automotive, healthcare, Internet of Things, ICT, safety and security, and aerospace. In order to support such wide variety of application scenarios, smart systems integrate a multitude of functionalities, technologies, and materials. The design of smart systems is therefore a complex and major multidisciplinary challenge, as it goes beyond the design of the individual components and subsystems. New design and simulation methodologies are fundamental for exploring the design space in order to find the most efficient trade-off between performance and involved resources, and for evaluating and validating system behavior taking into account the interactions between closely coupled components of different nature. Current system level design methods must indeed accurately manage increasing system complexity and interaction effects between the environment and the system and among the components. Nevertheless, the involved components are usually described using different languages, relying on different models of computation, and need to be jointly simulated at various abstraction levels. This dissertation aims at bridging this gap focusing on novel integration-aware solutions for different aspects of a smart system: the design of digital subsystems and components, the modeling of batteries, and the power estimation of smart systems at system level of design abstraction. Although the design flow of digital components is well consolidated and highly standardized (e.g., commercial, fully automated synthesis & optimization tools, technology libraries, etc.), additional integration-aware design constraints arise due to the interaction of components of different technological domains and to the harsh environment where smart systems typically operate. This work presents a methodology for addressing these new constraints, thus enhancing the design of digital components. As a partial fulfillment of such constraints results in a global degradation of performance, the proposed methodology focuses on the effects rather than the physical sources of the constraints. This allows to move from the typical RTL to a system level of abstraction, i.e., SystemC TLM, obtaining a faster validation of the performance of digital subsystems. Energy efficiency is becoming increasingly important for self-powered smart electronic systems, as the amount of energy they can gather from the environment or accumulate in storage devices cannot be considered constant over time. Power supplies have therefore a very heterogeneous nature: depending on the application, more than one type of power source (e.g., photovoltaic cells, thermoelectric or piezoelectric energy generators) and storage device (e.g., rechargeable and non-rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells) could be hosted onto the system. As a matter of fact, no single power source could provide the desired level of energy density, power density, current, and voltage to the system for all possible workloads. Batteries are being significantly used in smart electronic systems due to the their increased energy capacity, improved production process, and lower cost over the last years. However, a battery is an electrochemical device that involves complicated chemical reactions resulting in many non-idealities of its behavior. Therefore, a smart system designer has to characterize these non-idealities in order to accurately model how the battery delivers power to the system. This dissertation introduces a systematic methodology for the automatic construction of battery models from datasheet information, thus avoiding costly and time-consuming measurements of battery characteristics. This methodology allows generating models for several battery charge and discharge characteristics with tunable accuracy according to the amount of the available manufacturers\' data, and without any limitation in battery chemistry, materials, form factor, and size. Finally, this work introduces a modeling and simulation framework for the system level estimation of power end energy flows in smart systems. Current simulationor model-based design approaches do not target a smart system as a whole, but rather single domains (digital, analog, power devices, etc.), and make use of proprietary tools and pre-characterized models having fixed abstraction level and fixed semantics. The proposed methodology uses principles borrowed from the system level functional simulation of digital systems and extends them for simulating the behavior of subsystems whose functionality is to generate, convert, or store energy (e.g., power sources, voltage regulators, energy storage devices, etc.). This has been done at system level using standard open-source tools such as SystemC AMS and IP-XACT, which allow to explicitly represent current and voltage similarly to digital logic signals.

To cope with this issue, classification techniques robust to noisy data are needed. Bayesian approaches are known to be fairly robust to noise.

This paper proposes RIB (Robust Itemset-based Bayesian classifier), a novel eager and pattern-based Bayesian classifier which discovers frequent itemsets from training data and exploits them to build accurate probability estimates. Enforcing a minimum frequency of occurrence on the considered itemsets reduces the sensitivity of the probability estimates to noise. Furthermore, learning a Bayesian Network that also considers high-order dependences among data usually neglected by traditional Bayesian approaches appears to be more robust to noise and data overfitting than selecting a small subset of patterns tailored to each test instance. The experiments demonstrate that RIB is, on average, more accurate than most state-of-the-art classifiers, Bayesian and not, on benchmark datasets in which different kinds and levels of noise are injected.

One-time-factory manufacturing test is not sufficient anymore, and in-field testing (e.g., periodically, at power-on, during idle times) is becoming mandatory. Due to the strict constraints of in-field test, transparent BIST is extremely attractive, since it allows to minimize test invasiveness. This paper presents a cheap, high quality and practical SW-based transparent in-field test approach for memories within a system. Instead of using hardware BIST, the proposed scheme re-uses the CPU to perform in-field testing for all memories within the system. All quality metrics of the proposed solution (such as defect coverage, test time and code size) are analyzed. Case studies using the ARM instruction set architecture are provided to demonstrate the applicability of the solution. With the proposed approach no hardware BIST is necessary and speed-related faults are tackled, whereas results show the test time complexity of the SW-based transparent tests is the same as the one of the standard hardware BIST test. Moreover, data previously present in the memory is not corrupted with, in average, only a 30% increase in test program size with respect to non-transparent SW-based test', 1, 0, 1, 0, NULL, NULL, 'IEEE - INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC', '16th IEEE Latin American Test Symposium', '16th IEEE Latin American Test Symposium', NULL, NULL),

Global constraints are commonly enforced to focus the analysis on most interesting pattern sets. However, these constraints evaluate and select each pattern set individually based on its itemset characteristics. This paper extends traditional global constraints by proposing a novel constraint, called schema-based constraint, tailored to relational data. When coping with relational data itemsets consist of sets of items belonging to distinct data attributes, which constitute the itemset schema. The schema-based constraint allows us to effectively combine all the itemsets that are semantically correlated with each other into a unique pattern set, while filtering out those pattern sets covering a mixture of different data facets or giving a partial view of a single facet. Specifically, it selects all the pattern sets that are (i) composed only of frequent itemsets with the same schema and (ii) characterized by maximal size among those corresponding to that schema.

The main drivers for this growth are the widespread diffusion of mobile devices and the proliferation of datacenters, the most power-hungry IT facilities. In addition, it is predicted that the demand for ICT technologies and services will increase in the coming years. Finding solutions to decrease ICT energy footprint is and will be a top priority for researchers and professionals in the field. As a matter of fact, hardware technology has substantially improved throughout the years: modern ICT devices are definitely more energy efficient than their predecessors, in terms of performance per watt. However, as recent studies show, these improvements are not effectively reducing the growth rate of ICT energy consumption. This suggests that these devices are not used in an energy-efficient way. Hence, we have to look at software. Modern software applications are not designed and implemented with energy efficiency in mind. As hardware became more and more powerful (and cheaper), software developers were not concerned anymore with optimizing resource usage. Rather, they focused on providing additional features, adding layers of abstraction and complexity to their products. This ultimately resulted in bloated, slow software applications that waste hardware resources -- and consequently, energy.

For this purpose, the abstraction levels of software are traversed upwards, from source code to architectural components.

While there have been many notable success stories in getting probes to the Red Planet, the historical record is full of bad news. The success rate for actually landing on the Martian surface is even worse, roughly 30%. This low success rate must be mainly credited to the Mars environment characteristics. In the Mars atmosphere strong winds frequently breath. This phenomena usually modifies the lander descending trajectory diverging it from the target one. Moreover, the Mars surface is not the best place where performing a safe land. It is pitched by many and close craters and huge stones, and characterized by huge mountains and hills (e.g., Olympus Mons is 648 km in diameter and 27 km tall). For these reasons a mission failure due to a landing in huge craters, on big stones or on part of the surface characterized by a high slope is highly probable. In the last years, all space agencies have increased their research efforts in order to enhance the success rate of Mars missions. In particular, the two hottest research topics are: the active debris removal and the guided landing on Mars. The former aims at finding new methods to remove space debris exploiting unmanned spacecrafts. These must be able to autonomously: detect a debris, analyses it, in order to extract its characteristics in terms of weight, speed and dimension, and, eventually, rendezvous with it. In order to perform these tasks, the spacecraft must have high vision capabilities. In other words, it must be able to take pictures and process them with very complex image processing algorithms in order to detect, track and analyse the debris. The latter aims at increasing the landing point precision (i.e., landing ellipse) on Mars. Future space-missions will increasingly adopt Video Based Navigation systems to assist the entry, descent and landing (EDL) phase of space modules (e.g., spacecrafts), enhancing the precision of automatic EDL navigation systems. For instance, recent space exploration missions, e.g., Spirity, Oppurtunity, and Curiosity, made use of an EDL procedure aiming at following a fixed and precomputed descending trajectory to reach a precise landing point. This approach guarantees a maximum landing point precision of 20 km. By comparing this data with the Mars environment characteristics, it is possible to understand how the mission failure probability still remains really high. A very challenging problem is to design an autonomous-guided EDL system able to even more reduce the landing ellipse, guaranteeing to avoid the landing in dangerous area of Mars surface (e.g., huge craters or big stones) that could lead to the mission failure. The autonomous behaviour of the system is mandatory since a manual driven approach is not feasible due to the distance between Earth and Mars. Since this distance varies from 56 to 100 million of km approximately due to the orbit eccentricity, even if a signal transmission at the light speed could be possible, in the best case the transmission time would be around 31 minutes, exceeding so the overall duration of the EDL phase. In both applications, algorithms must guarantee self-adaptability to the environmental conditions. Since the Mars (and in general the space) harsh conditions are difficult to be predicted at design time, these algorithms must be able to automatically tune the internal parameters depending on the current conditions. Moreover, real-time performances are another key factor. Since a software implementation of these computational intensive tasks cannot reach the required performances, these algorithms must be accelerated via hardware. For this reasons, this thesis presents my research work done on advanced image processing algorithms for space applications and the associated hardware accelerators. My research activity has been focused on both the algorithm and their hardware implementations. Concerning the first aspect, I mainly focused my research effort to integrate self-adaptability features in the existing algorithms. While concerning the second, I studied and validated a methodology to efficiently develop, verify and validate hardware components aimed at accelerating video-based applications. This approach allowed me to develop and test high performance hardware accelerators that strongly overcome the performances of the actual state-of-the-art implementations. The thesis is organized in four main chapters. Chapter 2 starts with a brief introduction about the story of digital image processing. The main content of this chapter is the description of space missions in which digital image processing has a key role. A major effort has been spent on the missions in which my research activity has a substantial impact. In particular, for these missions, this chapter deeply analizes and evaluates the state-of-the-art approaches and algorithms. Chapter 3 analyzes and compares the two technologies used to implement high performances hardware accelerators, i.e., Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Thanks to this information the reader may understand the main reasons behind the decision of space agencies to exploit FPGAs instead of ASICs for high-performance hardware accelerators in space missions, even if FPGAs are more sensible to Single Event Upsets (i.e., transient error induced on hardware component by alpha particles and solar radiation in space). Moreover, this chapter deeply describes the three available space-grade FPGA technologies (i.e., One-time Programmable, Flash-based, and SRAM-based), and the main fault-mitigation techniques against SEUs that are mandatory for employing space-grade FPGAs in actual missions. Chapter 4 describes one of the main contribution of my research work: a library of high-performance hardware accelerators for image processing in space applications. The basic idea behind this library is to offer to designers a set of validated hardware components able to strongly speed up the basic image processing operations commonly used in an image processing chain. In other words, these components can be directly used as elementary building blocks to easily create a complex image processing system, without wasting time in the debug and validation phase. This library groups the proposed hardware accelerators in IP-core families. The components contained in a same family share the same provided functionality and input/output interface. This harmonization in the I/O interface enables to substitute, inside a complex image processing system, components of the same family without requiring modifications to the system communication infrastructure. In addition to the analysis of the internal architecture of the proposed components, another important aspect of this chapter is the methodology used to develop, verify and validate the proposed high performance image processing hardware accelerators. This methodology involves the usage of different programming and hardware description languages in order to support the designer from the algorithm modelling up to the hardware implementation and validation. Chapter 5 presents the proposed complex image processing systems. In particular, it exploits a set of actual case studies, associated with the most recent space agency needs, to show how the hardware accelerator components can be assembled to build a complex image processing system. In addition to the hardware accelerators contained in the library, the described complex system embeds innovative ad-hoc hardware components and software routines able to provide high performance and self-adaptable image processing functionalities.

Posynomial models are widely used in various engineering design endeavors, such as circuits, aerospace and structural design, mainly due to the fact that design problems cast in terms of posynomial objectives and constraints can be solved efficiently by means of a convex optimization technique known as geometric programming (GP). However, while quite a vast literature exists on GP-based design, very few contributions can yet be found on the problem of identifying posynomial models from experimental data. Posynomial identification amounts to determining not only the coefficients of the combination, but also the exponents in the monomials, which renders the identification problem hard. In this paper, we propose an approach to the identification of multivariate posynomial models based on the expansion on a given large-scale basis of monomials.

This is a relevant issue, since space junk hampers the access road to space and raises collision threats. Some countries have already identified as unavoidable solution the complete stop of future launches of satellites. Hence, several research projects all over the world are trying to address the space debris removal problem. In our work, we focused on the problem of developing strategies for the non cooperative rendezvous and capture of space debris by exploiting a 3D stereo camera in order to obtain information about their motion: we need to precisely evaluate the space debris kinematics in order to select and design the best removal techniques. Many research projects have investigated radar or other sensors, well established and adopted on Earth. Actually the clear limits in the space forced us to investigate the adoption of a simple couple of cameras mounted on a stereo frameset: such a vision system is compact, very light, low power demanding and not passive (not sending active radiation to an unknown object with unknown reactions), hence an ideal candidate for space mission payloads. Nevertheless the use of a vision system for this purpose is extremely challenging. Strong sun light in the space environment, the absence of Rayleigh scattering and almost uniform colours of the target highly reduce the accuracy of depth from stereo approaches. The same problems affect the estimation of the kinematics and the evaluation the inertial forces the debris is subject to, which require a reliable tracking of feature points on theobject surface. To this end, we developed a robust approach for obtaining, from a sequence of stereo images, the motion history of clouds of 3D points on the debris surface.

The proposed approach is able to estimate system reliability considering both the hardware and the software layer of a system, in presence of hardware transient and permanent faults. In fact, when digital system reliability is under analysis, hardware resources of the processor and instructions of program traces are employed to build a Bayesian Network. Finally, the probability of input errors to alter both the correct behavior of the system and the output of the program is computed.

The algorithm is based on the definition of a metric of the estimate accuracy, and on the application of an agreement protocol based on max-consensus. We prove the convergence, in finite time, of all the local estimates to the most accurate one at each discrete iteration, as well as the equivalence with a centralised Kalman filter with multiple measurements, evolving according to a state-dependent switching dynamics.

Method: We conducted an exploratory study implemented by a survey in the context of a German research project with a broad range of used mediums. Results: The main reported barriers were low expectations of usefulness, no awareness of existence, lack of resources, or inadequateness in terms of outdated material or being in an immature state.

However, there is limited knowledge on the current state of practice and how to assess the success of technology transfer. Objective: We aim at elaborating a set of hypotheses on how technology transfer takes place in Software Engineering research projects. Method: We designed an exploratory survey with the participants of two large research projects in Germany, which involve both industrial and academic partners in the area of modeldriven development for embedded systems. Results: Base on the extracted respondents answers of this survey, we defined a resulting theory which is based on the following set of main hypothesis: Most of the technologies developed in research projects are not mature enough for a direct application, but need post-project customisation to fit the industrial contexts (H1). Common models that represent technology transfer as a transaction of an object from a transferor to a transferee does not fit industrial reality (H2). Additionally, technology transfer takes place without an explicit process (H3). Regarding transfer mediums, most used mediums are human-intensive (H5) and industry organisations gain new knowledge mainly within their own confines (H4). Finally the motivations that drive the transfer in industry and academia are heterogenous (H6). Conclusions: From the theoretical perspective, this theory and set of hypotheses extracted from the survey results will be further explored and tested in different follow-up activities.

As such uncertainties are intolerable in certain application domains such as automotive and avionic infotainment systems, it has become a persistent necessity to customize runtime engines to introduce measures for variability awareness in task allocation decisions. The purpose of compensating process variability is to avoid performance degradation and energy inefficiency. And customization is meant to take place automatically through exporting the variability-impacted platform characteristics - such as per-core manufactured clock frequency - for the runtime library to perform variability-aware workload sharing on the target cores of the hardware platform.

They reduce stand-by power consumption by inserting a high-threshold cut-off MOSFET (i.e., a sleep transistor) in series to the initial low-threshold circuit. Hence, sub-threshold leakage current is reduced by the sleep transistor while performance loss is controlled. The latter happens thanks to two factors: First, the sleep transistor can be made very large (i.e., with low resistance), because it is shared among many cells; second, the large capacitance of the net connecting the cells and the sleep transistors provides a low-impedance AC discharge path, i.e., a virtual ground for the transient currents created by the switching gates. MTCMOS techniques present two drawbacks. First, they still require process modifications for supporting the high-threshold of the sleep MOSFET. Second, when a circuit is deactivated by power gating, it takes a non-negligible amount of time to wake up and reactivate it, simply because the large sleep transistor must be switched on and it must initially discharge the slow virtual ground capacitance. The first drawback can be eliminated if the sleep transistor is fabricated with the same threshold as the other transistors in the circuit. Even though leakage reduction is less substantial, the stacking effect still provides significant benefits. To address the second limitation, several sleep transistor approaches have been proposed, where multiple smaller sleep transistors are instantiated. The main advantage of sleep transistor insertion is having designs with a faster re-activation time when exiting the sleep state. However, the MTCMOS paradigm has found substantial application and positive results mostly in custom applications, e.g., microprocessors, where design and optimization is hand-crafted, while it is still seldom used in ASICs and SoCs, for which design is performed automatically through RTL-to-physical synthesis.

In fact, the chosen highly elliptical frozen orbits provide coverage over an area centered at the South Pole and of 1500 km radius with at least 4 satellites always in view, which is the minimum number for our positioning algorithm to work. Each satellite is equipped with a clock so that it can emit pulse-like signals that are received by the user, which is equipped with another clock and so it is able to count the pulses emitted by the different nanosatellites. A ground station at the South Pole updates the ephemerides and the proper times of the satellites, transmitting them periodically to the users. In this paper we analyze the architecture of such a mission, describing in details the concept of operations, orbits, and nanosatellites subsystems, maximizing the use of components off the shelf. We also include an implementation plan and a cost model, highlighting the sustainability of the project. Finally, a set of ground tests to qualify this mission for lunar orbit is described, and its top five technical and programmatic risks are discussed', 0, 0, 0, 0, NULL, '978-2-917761-38-0', 'International Academy of Astrunautics', NULL, 'Inventive Ideas for Micro/Nano-Satellites.

It increases the threshold voltage of pMOS transistors, which slows down signal propagation along the paths between flip-flops. As a consequence, NBTI may cause transient faults and, ultimately, permanent circuit functional failure. In this paper, we propose an innovative NBTI mitigation approach by rejuvenation of nanoscale logic along NBTI-critical paths. The method is based on hierarchical NBTI-critical paths identification and rejuvenation stimuli generation using an Evolutionary Algorithm. The rejuvenation stimuli are used to drive to the recovery phase the pMOS transistors that are the most significant for the NBTI-induced path delay. This rejuvenation procedure is to be applied to the circuit as an execution overhead at predefined periods. The proposed approach is aimed at extending the reliable lifetime of nanoelectronics. Experimental results are demonstrated by electrical simulations of an ALU circuit design', 1, 0, 1, 0, NULL, '9781467367103', 'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc', '16th IEEE Latin-American Test Symposium, LATS 2015', '2015 16th Latin-American Test Symposium, LATS 2015', NULL, '10.1109/LATW.2015.7102405');
